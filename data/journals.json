In this study, we developed an adaptive evolution method coupled with centrifugal fractionation and pH shifting to enhance SCP production by Trichosporon cutaneum from wheat straw. During the adaptive evolution, the culture pH was shifted from 5.0 to 7.0, which is more favorable for SCP accumulation of T. cutaneum. The finally obtained T. cutaneum CL160 exhibited a 109.2% increase in SCP content compared to the parental strain. The DCW and SCP titer of T. cutaneum CL160 reached 48.6 ± 1.5 g/L and 14.2 ± 1.1 g/L using wheat straw clarified hydrolysate by batch fermentation. Fed-batch fermentation using wheat straw-derived syrup further improved DCW and SCP titer to 124.2 g/L and 32.6 g/L. Further attempts were performed to prepare soluble yeast extract from lignocellulose-derived SCP by cell autolysis. This yeast extract served as an effective nitrogen source for lactic acid fermentation by Pediococcus acidilactici, achieving 83.2 ± 1.1 g/L lactic acid titer and 45 × 10",

The Saudi Healthy Plate 2024 (SHP-2024) was developed by the National Nutrition Committee of the Saudi Food and Drug Authority to address the population's nutritional needs and reduce the burden of NCDs. SHP-2024 provides balanced and culturally appropriate dietary recommendations.\n\nSHP-2024 was designed using optimization modeling techniques, incorporating global best practices, expert consultations, and rigorous validation processes. The dietary patterns were calibrated to ensure nutritional adequacy and economic feasibility.

Nutritional constraints and economic assessments adhered to Saudi regulatory standards and data from the General Authority for Statistics.\n\nSHP-2024 met the average requirements for most macronutrients and micronutrients, including protein, key vitamins, and minerals, across all calorie patterns. However, the amount of vitamin E provided by SHP-2024, relative to the average requirement of 12.00 mg (95% CI: 8.40-15.60), covered only 60.93% of requirement in males and 60.61% in females. Choline intake with average requirement of 320.00 mg (95% CI: 224.00-416.00), met 73.71% of requirement in males and 73.36% in females. The cost of dietary patterns ranged from 380.70 to 762.70 SAR, indicating overall affordability.\n\nSHP-2024 provides optimized dietary guidance suited to Saudi needs, supporting efforts to reduce NCD burdens. While most nutritional targets were achieved, persistent gaps in vitamin E and choline intake require targeted strategies in future updates to enhance dietary adequacy.",

Here, we report a detailed analysis of the structure-function relationship of MtPMT, the enzyme that catalyzes POM in Mtb. Using mutagenesis and in cellulo monitoring of POM activity, we demonstrate that, despite notable structural differences, MtPMT shares functional homologies with yeasts' PMTs in the mechanism of the sugar transfer from lipidic donors. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the selectivity for proline-rich target glycosylation sites that differentiates MtPMT from its eukaryotic homologues, relies on a WW-like domain, which preferentially interacts with proline-rich acceptor substrate analogues. This first identification of a functional WW-like domain in a prokaryotic protein raises questions about its potential evolutionary linkage with eukaryotic WW modules and provides new insights into PMT's acceptor-substrate recognition mechanism paving the way for the development selective inhibitors of MtPMT with potential therapeutic application against tuberculosis.",

Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets necessary for developing algorithms to support scenarios where AID systems revert to manual mode. This study addresses this gap by providing a detailed, multimodal dataset encompassing five key aspects: blood glucose levels; basal and bolus insulin dosages; nutritional intake (carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fibre content); physical activity (step count, active calories, distance covered, MET, and intensity level); and sleep patterns. The dataset includes longitudinal (3-month) real-world data collected from 17 PwT1D participants.

Notably, dysmyelination in the corpus callosum serves as a prominent element connecting GDM and autism in the white matter lesions.\n\nThe cumulative effects of GDM and prenatal VPA on both autistic behavior and dysmyelination in progeny have been investigated in this study.\n\nIn vivo, female mice exhibiting leptin receptor deficiencies and maintained on a high-fat diet were utilized to create GDM models, to which prenatal VPA was administered. In vitro, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were treated with VPA in the high-fat and high-glucose culture.\n\nThe offspring subjected to both GDM and prenatal VPA demonstrated comparable declines in social interaction, myelination, and OPC maturation, akin to those exclusively exposed to VPA. Remarkably, the application of clemastine facilitated remyelination, ameliorated autistic behaviors, and promoted the progression of OPCs. Furthermore, the compromised myelination and OPC maturation instigated by the combination of GDM and prenatal VPA were found to be less severe compared to those precipitated by VPA alone. This differential impact can be attributed to the opposing influences of GDM and VPA on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor activation in OPCs, extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) phosphorylation in OPCs, and the modulation of histone deacetylase 3 and dual specificity phosphatase 5 expression.\n\nwe delineate the antagonistic effects of GDM and prenatal VPA on ERK phosphorylation in fetal OPCs, consequently altering their proliferation and differentiation, thereby culminating in milder dysmyelination and autistic behaviors.",

Deficiency of PPDPF inhibited the development of ESCC in mice.

The precise pathophysiological mechanisms triggering obesity-related kidney impairment remain elusive, especially after dietary correction. Male C57BL6/J mice (n=15) were divided in: control group (CTR) fed with standard chow; a group fed with HFD for 200 days (28-29 weeks); and a group fed with HFD for 60 days (8-9 weeks) and then with standard chow (HFDt)(∼21 weeks). Biometric data and whole-body metabolism were assessed. Expression of genes associated with mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial complexes and antioxidant defenses were analyzed. Kidney homogenates enriched in mitochondria were prepared and characterized by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Kidney tissue of mice fed HFD exhibited reduced PGC-1α expression, an imbalance between fusion (increased MFN1 and decreased OPA1) and fission (decreased FIS1 and DRP1) processes. The activity of mitochondrial CI was increased, while activity of CII was decreased in the kidney after HFD and HFDt. Antioxidant defense Manganese Superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was decreased in the kidney of HFD, while Glutathione reductase (GR) increased, with both activities being restored upon dietary reversion. Proteomic analysis showed alterations in proteins associated with glutathione and glycine metabolism, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and peroxisomal function. HFD negatively impacted kidney glutathione related proteins (Gsta3 and Gsr) however dietary correction reverted this condition. Acsm3 protein was downregulated in kidney after HFD and upregulated after dietary correction. Some machinery is shared by mitochondria and peroxisomes, with their network being crucial particularly under stress conditions. A HFD impaired kidney FAO in peroxisomes, as evidenced by downregulation of Pecr after HFD and HFDt. Dietary correction after early-obesity mitigates the systemic metabolic dysfunction and can attenuate mitochondria dysfunction but is unable to completely restore mitochondria dynamics and bioenergetics. The results highlight the integrity of mitochondrial network as a main point for targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing the progression of kidney disease.",

This study investigates the potential of acyclovir (ACY) analogs in controlling WSSV using molecular docking/dynamics simulations and ecotoxicological studies. Among the compounds tested, GCV and TFV exhibited favorable energetic and statistical properties compared to ACY. This suggests that polar groups are crucial for interactions with key amino acid residues (Gln138, Met139, Asn154, and Ser156) of the VP28 protein, which is essential for binding specificity. Toxicity assessments showed that ACY and its analogs have low acute toxicity in aquatic species, including fish, D. magna, and G. algae. Notably, CDY and TFV demonstrated latency effects in D. magna and fish. Chronic toxicity predictions indicated that GCV showed no toxicity in ECOSAR models. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the GCV/VP28 complex was the most stable, with the greatest potential for protein inhibition, as evidenced by significant hydrogen bond occupancy and binding free energy. These findings highlight the promising potential of GCV as a candidate for WSSV inhibition, providing valuable insights for future antiviral development to mitigate WSSV's economic and social impacts in aquaculture.",

    "combined_text": "Untargeted Discovery and Localization of Isomerized Residues in Neuropeptides.\n\nA reliable and effective analytical method for discovering and characterizing isomerized residues in physiologically active peptides is essential for their comprehensive characterization. Complete structural detail facilitates the determination of a peptide's biological roles and meets the increasingly stringent demands for peptide-based therapeutics. Here, a comprehensive untargeted analytical workflow predicts possible peptide isomers from peptidomics data and then localizes the isomerized residues by using collision-induced dissociation-trapped ion mobility spectrometry (CID-TIMS) and protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) activity. The approach allows for the discovery and characterization of isomerized isoaspartate (isoAsp) residues and D-amino acids within the peptide. Potential isomeric peptide candidates are first identified from peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) obtained after a database search by applying a defined retention-time window and comparing the differential ion-mobility values of precursor ions corresponding to nominally identical peptides. CID-TIMS is then utilized to locate the isomerized amino acid(s) within the predicted isomers by comparing the mobilities of fragment ions detected at those retention times. Finally, PIMT is used to label isoAsp residues for confirmation. This integrated workflow enabled the localization of isoAsp residues in eight peptides from the rat hypothalamus. These peptides are from six prohormones, including proenkephalin, promelanin-concentrating hormone, secretogranin II, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and prosomatostatin. To show its broad utility, our workflow successfully identified a D-amino acid-containing form of small cardioactive peptide B, FMRFamide, and another D-amino acid-containing peptide from an uncharacterized protein in the sea slug",

Protein energy percentage was inversely associated with energy intake (β: -0.33; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.27). Response surfaces revealed that lower proportional energy from protein, diluted by high fat and/or carbohydrate, was associated with higher total energy intake and greater 12-month increases in body weight, WHtR, and HHtR, but not FMI. Consumption of discretionary food, not other food sources, increased energy intake by reducing proportional energy from protein.\n\nMaintaining dietary proportional energy from protein, particularly by limiting discretionary food consumption, was associated with reduced energy intake and improved WLM.",

A 21-day experiment was conducted using 270 one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers, randomly divided to three dietary treatments: a basal diet, a group supplemented with 350 mg/kg MMT, and a group supplemented with 350 mg/kg Cu-MMT. The results revealed that dietary supplementation with Cu-MMT significantly decreased the abundance of intestinal pathogens (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Clostridia).

    "combined_text": "Evolution and transmission dynamics of infectious bronchitis virus in southern China during 2018-2023: Emergence of a novel GI-19 subtype and re-emergence of GI-28.\n\nInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the major diseases affecting the poultry industry worldwide. The high mutation rates of viral genome pose serious challenges to the prevention and control of IB. Based on our previous studies on IBV isolates in southern China during 2009-2017, we continued to carry out the genetic evolution analyses of S1 gene from IBV isolates during 2018-2023. Furthermore, we investigated the temporal and geographical origin of 245 IBV strains from southern China during 1985-2023, and reconstructed their transmission dynamics. Our findings revealed that GI-19 (LX4-type) was still the most dominant genotype, with the coexistence of multiple genotypes. Notably, the GI-19 strains were further classified into three subgroups, one of which was a new GI-19 subtype with nucleotide sequence similarities less than 90 % compared to the vaccine strain QXL87, along with five and eight consecutive amino acid substitutions, respectively. GI-28 (LDT3-A-type) strains re-emerged in 2019 and remained predominant thereafter. In addition, there was an increasing isolation rate of GI-7 (Taiwan-I-type). The purification pressure was detected in the S1 protein IBV isolates during 2018-2023, but eight positive selection sites with high entropy values were identified. Five isolates were confirmed to be recombinants, and GI-22 strains involved in all five recombinants as major or minor parents. The estimated times for the most recent common ancestors based on the S1 gene was the years of 1905. Bayesian skyline analysis indicated a rapid increase in genetic diversity of the S1 gene in IBV strains since late 2015. Bayesian geographical analysis demonstrated that the southern China IBVs originated from Nanning and identified four principal transmission pathways. In conclusion, our findings revealed the emergence of a new GI-19 subtype of IBV, the re-emergence of GI-28, and multiple transmission routes in southern China during 2018-2023, underscoring the importance of real-time and continuous surveillance of circulating strains and the urgency of developing safe, effective, and broad-spectrum new vaccines against emerging and re-emerging IBVs.",

This study identified Pichia kudriavzevii M420 as the primary microorganism responsible for pellicle formation in fermented chili peppers, which significantly reduced the levels of organic acids, free amino acids, and aroma compounds. Consequently, this altered the sensory profile of pickles by diminishing sourness and sweetness, increasing bitterness, and introducing a wine-like flavor along with other undesirable odors, thereby compromising overall quality. Co-culturing with Pediococcus ethanolidurans M1117 effectively inhibited pellicle formation through microbial interactions with P. kudriavzevii M420. Transcriptome analysis revealed substantial downregulation of genes in P. kudriavzevii M420, particularly those involved in energy metabolism, genetic information processing, and cellular functions. Notably, inhibition of protein synthesis was identified as a crucial mechanism in preventing pellicle formation. These findings provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pellicle formation and highlight the potential of P. ethanolidurans M1117 as an innovative biocontrol strategy to enhance the quality and safety of fermented chili peppers.",

While ozonated water stress causes severe leaf damage in plants, little is known about its effects on cucumber leaves and underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the effects of spraying ozonated water on cucumber seedlings by integrating physiological phenotypes with molecular mechanisms. The results showed that spraying ozonated water led to the disorder of leaf anatomical structure, damage of the photosynthetic system, and the chlorophyll content decreased significantly. Significant changes in oxidative damage indicators, osmotic adjustment substances accumulated, and the antioxidant system were damaged. Transcriptome analysis indicated that spraying ozonated water strongly regulated the expression of stress defense genes. GO and KEGG analyses showed that DEGs were primarily enriched in pathways related to plant antioxidant responses. In addition, in the WGCNA analysis, multiple transcription factors and protein kinases were identified. Metabolomics studies were also conducted, and KEGG enrichment analysis mainly enriched in glutathione metabolism and related amino acid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis indicated that spraying ozonated water activated and increased genes and metabolites related to oxidative stress in cucumbers to resist the damage caused by ozonated water stress. Our study systematically revealed how cucumber seedlings adapt to ozonated water stress through physiological and molecular mechanisms, providing a scientific basis for optimizing its agricultural application.",

Cases were aged 18-64 years with an untreated psychotic disorder diagnosed according to ICD 10 criteria. Control participants were matched for age, sex, and neighbourhood.

We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) using unconditional logistic regression.\n\nWe included 225, 209, and 212 case-control pairs, respectively in Kancheepuram (India), Ibadan (Nigeria), and Northern Trinidad. Among cases, we found marked variations in health behaviours and physical health indicators across settings. In case-control comparisons within settings, cases were more likely to report poor diet (aORs of 1.31 [Trinidad] to 3.70 [Ibadan]), current smoking (aORs of 2.21 [Kancheepuram] to 3.35 [Trinidad]), and physical inactivity (aORs of 0.23 [Ibadan] to 0.62 [Kancheepuram]).

However, the role and specific mechanism of Ses in PFOS-induced liver inflammation remain largely unclear.\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotection and potential mechanism of Ses against PFOS-induced inflammation.\n\nWild-type (WT), Mincle knockout (Ko-mincle), and Hepatocyte-specific knockout Foxo1 (Hko-Foxo1) mice were intragastrically administered Ses and/or PFOS (10 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. In vitro, HepG2 cells were pretreated with Ses for 1 h, then exposed to PFOS for 24 h to establish a cell injury model.\n\nWe revealed that Ses markedly alleviated PFOS-induced liver injury and inflammation, as evidenced by noticeable histopathological improvements, increased cell activity, and alterations in serum liver enzyme and inflammatory factor levels. Moreover, Ses pretreatment reduced the expression of Mincle and the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, SYK and p65, in macrophages. The reducing effect of Ses on liver inflammation in wild-type mice is significantly better than that in Mincle knockout mice. We also found that Ses decreased the expression of spliceosome-associated protein 130 (SAP130) and Foxo1. Further experiments revealed that SAP130 may serve as a mediator between hepatocytes and macrophages. Hepatocyte-specific knockout Foxo1 reduced the release of SAP130 from hepatocytes and inhibited Mincle/Syk signaling activation in macrophages.\n\nThis study demonstrates that Ses protects against PFOS-induced liver inflammation in mice by modulating crosstalk between hepatocytes and macrophages.

This study assessed the metal content of 56 plant-based PS samples from European sources using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Dietary exposure to these elements was evaluated across three consumption scenarios, considering established reference intake values (AI/TDI/TWI/UL) and the Margin of Exposure (MOE) for lead (Pb). The analysis identified plant-based PS as significant sources of essential elements, including sodium (9101.66 mg/kg), potassium (5784.91 mg/kg), calcium (2201.45 mg/kg), molybdenum (1.63 mg/kg), manganese (25.14 mg/kg), copper (11.59 mg/kg), iron (132.58 mg/kg), zinc (62.56 mg/kg), chromium (0.45 mg/kg), and cobalt (0.11 mg/kg).

At the recommended consumption level of 30 g/day, exposure to both essential and PTEs did not exceed reference intake limits. However, this dose accounted for 75 % of the Adequate Intake (AI) for molybdenum. Excessive consumption (100 g/day) raised concerns about exceeding the AI for copper (105.40 %) and magnesium (105.90 %) in women, as well as molybdenum (250.16 %) and iron (120.53 %) for men and postmenopausal women.

Higher MIND diet scores were associated with lower odds of HS (odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.95) and HS with LATE-NC (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.97) after controlling for age at death, sex, education, total calories, APOE-ε4 status, AD, and vascular pathologies. In mediation analyses, the MIND diet was associated with less dementia at the time of death (β = -0.26; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.15; P < .001), with an indirect association of 21% through HS (β = -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01; P = .02). A higher MIND diet score was associated with less hippocampal neuronal loss (P for trend = .01).\n\nThis cohort study of autopsied participants found that MIND diet adherence during follow-up was associated with a lower likelihood of HS, HS with LATE-NC, and hippocampal neuronal loss. The association of diet with dementia was partially mediated by its association with HS. These findings suggest that the MIND diet may reduce adverse brain health outcomes.",

While inflammatory proteins are known to play crucial roles in cancer development, their causal relationships with breast cancer risk remain inadequately understood. This study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate potential causal associations between inflammatory proteins and breast cancer susceptibility.\n\nWe utilized genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for inflammatory protein levels from 14,824 European individuals as exposure data. The primary outcome data were obtained from BC GWAS summary statistics, with an additional independent BC cohort serving as validation(FinnGen_R12). The primary analysis was conducted using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, supplemented by MR-Egger and weighted median approaches. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses included Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out analysis. The causal direction was verified through Steiger test and reverse MR. We further performed multivariable MR (MVMR), linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), and colocalization analysis to strengthen our findings.\n\nAfter Bonferroni correction, we identified a significant inverse genetic association between Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) levels and BC risk. While C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5) did not survive Bonferroni correction, it showed significant negative association with BC in MVMR analysis. Reverse MR analyses found no evidence of causal effects of BC on these inflammatory proteins, supporting the direction of our primary findings. Colocalization analysis revealed strong evidence of shared genetic variants between LIFR and BC, suggesting common genetic determinants underlying their relationship.\n\nThis study provides genetic evidence for causal relationships between inflammatory proteins and BC risk, particularly highlighting the protective role of LIFR. These findings enhance our understanding of BC pathogenesis and may inform future therapeutic strategies.",

    "combined_text": "Reduction of Tooth Replacement Disproportionately Affects the Evolution of Enamel Matrix Proteins.\n\nIn most vertebrates, teeth are continuously shed and replaced throughout life, while mammals and several lineages of reptiles have reduced replacement to only one or two generations. In contrast to the vast majority of their living relatives, members of the lizard families Chamaeleonidae and Agamidae have dispensed with lifelong tooth replacement, instead developing acrodont dentition that fuses to the jawbone to be used for the lifetime of the animal. Though, the loss of tooth replacement has not come without a cost. In order to mitigate the consequences that come with tooth replacement loss, mammals and acrodont lizards have evolved adaptations that strengthen enamel structure and minimize wear and tear experienced during the life of the animal. While these physical adaptations are well documented, the effect that loss of tooth replacement has had on the molecular components of teeth has not received significant attention. Here, we analyze the coding and amino acid sequences of six tooth proteins (AMBN, AMEL, AMTN, ACP4, ENAM, and MMP20) from acrodont lizards, pleurodont lizards that replace teeth, and mammals. We show that the reduction of tooth generations has disproportionately affected the evolutionary trajectory of proteins associated with enamel structure, with a particularly magnified effect on the evolution of AMEL.",

Huangsan is rich in proteins, polysaccharides, which has been documented to be used in the treatment of cancer. However, the pharmacological mechanism of Huangsan in the treatment of cancer remains unclear. This research examined the anticancer mechanisms of the ethanol extract of P. adiposa (EPA) in hepatoma-bearing mice via metabolomic analysis. Male ICR mice were randomly assigned to the control (CG), model (MG), positive (25 mg/kg/day cyclophosphamide; PG), low-level EPA (LG, 100 mg/kg/day), and high-level EPA (HG, 300 mg/kg/day) groups. Various biochemical indicators were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Western blot was utilized to assess tumor apoptosis-related caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bcl-2-associated X, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and chemometric approaches were applied to determine serum metabolomics. EPA substantially impacted tumor growth in vivo without causing adverse reactions, indicating liver and kidney protection. EPA significantly increased the levels of glutamine, leucine, histidine, citrulline, creatine, prostaglandin A2, and prostaglandin D2 while decreasing levels of arachidonic acid, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, thromboxane B2, and pyruvate. These changes reflected a reduction in protein digestion and absorption, alterations in γ-aminobutyric acid metabolism, and shifts in amino acid metabolism, particularly affecting arachidonic acid, arginine, and proline. EPA exerted significant anticancer effects in mice mainly by reducing the compensatory energy supply from branched-chain amino acids, regulating amino acid metabolism, inhibiting negative nitrogen balance, enhancing immune responses, inhibiting inflammatory mediators, and promoting tumor cell apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment.",

Simple biomarkers to predict residual disease burden and prognosis are clinically valuable. The hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score reflects inflammation and nutritional status. This study evaluated the association of the HALP score with the residual Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score (rSS) and 12-month major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in T2DM patients with NSTEMI.\n\nThis retrospective study included 210 diabetic patients. Participants were stratified into three groups based on rSS (0, 1-8, > 8). HALP scores were calculated from admission laboratory values, and outcomes were followed for 12 months. Associations between HALP and rSS were assessed using Spearman correlation and multivariable regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a HALP cut-off value for predicting high rSS. The prognostic value for MACE was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis.\n\nHALP scores were significantly lower in patients with rSS > 8 (P < 0.001) and were negatively associated with rSS (β = -0.344, P < 0.001). The optimal HALP score cut-off for predicting rSS > 8 was 2.96, with 78% sensitivity and 77% specificity. Patients with HALP ≤ 2.96 had a higher prevalence of rSS > 8 (43.7% vs. 6.5%) and experienced more MACE over 12 months (29.6% vs. 13.7%, P = 0.005). In Cox analysis, a low HALP score (≤ 2.96) was an independent predictor of MACE, along with age and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (hazard ratio = 1.916, P = 0.045).\n\nLower HALP scores are associated with higher residual disease burden and worse outcomes.

The review followed the 5-step methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley for scoping reviews and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist to ensure a comprehensive search strategy. Protein intake was assessed using various methods, including grams per day, grams per kilogram of body weight per day, and intake quartiles. Sarcopenia-related outcomes were categorized into 3 domains as follows: muscle mass, strength, and physical performance. Although most intervention studies demonstrated improvements in muscle mass following protein supplementation, findings on muscle strength and physical function were inconsistent. Cross-sectional studies generally reported better sarcopenia-related outcomes with higher protein intake, particularly when the intake was expressed relative to body weight or analyzed according to quartiles. However, heterogeneity in protein intake assessments and variations in sarcopenia definitions could have contributed to the inconsistent findings across studies. This review highlights the need for applying standardized approaches for protein intake measurement and sarcopenia diagnosis. Future studies should consider the quantity, quality, and timing of protein intake while also focusing on the implementation of integrated, multidisciplinary intervention strategies to promote healthy aging among Korean older adults.",

After adjusting for covariates, individuals in the highest quartile of carbohydrate-to-energy intake (> 80%) had 41% higher odds of having cataracts (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-2.01), with a significant trend (p for trend = 0.022). In contrast, the highest quartile of protein intake (Q3: 12%-15% energy) was associated with significantly lower odds of having cataracts in women (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.88).

Saturated and monounsaturated fat intake also showed inverse associations with the odds of having cataracts. These results suggest that excessive carbohydrate intake, particularly when replacing fats and proteins, may increase the odds of having cataracts in older adults, especially among women. Dietary adjustments aimed at reducing the proportion of carbohydrates and increasing high-quality protein and fat intake may help prevent cataracts in aging populations.

The proximate composition of formulated complementary Infant food was analyzed, and the reported values ranged from 7.13 ± 0.03 to 13.31 ± 0.01 g (moisture), 2.76 ± 0.03 to 3.35 ± 0.02 g (ash), 7.83 ± 0.02 to 15.97 ± 0.03 g (protein), 2.68 ± 0.02 to 4.27 ± 0.02 g (fat), 2.67 ± 0.02 to 12.11 ± 0.02 g (fiber), 54.87 ± 0.02 to 69.34 ± 0.03 g (carbohydrates), and energy: 301.62 ± 0.02 to 360.47 ± 0.03 kcal/100 g. The studied results reported a better food composition: 59.5 g of Oat-Teff (1:1 mixture), 30.5 g of Carrot powder, and 10 g of Jaggery supported with a maximum desirability of 0.9736. The sensory attributes (using a seven-point hedonic scale) of formulated best-optimized complementary food compositions were 6.24 ± 0.49 (taste), 6.39 ± 0.13 (flavor), 6.51 ± 0.04 (color), 5.84 ± 0.14 (texture), 6.47 ± 1.24 (appearance), 5.87 ± 0.73 (mouthfeel), and 6.55 ± 0.58 (overall acceptability). Thus, the studied results conclude that the formulated optimized composite food is promising, unique, and value-added to the coarse cereals (Oat and Teff), Carrot, and Jaggery under the complementary composite food category of Infant food.",

Thus, with the evolution of alimentary habits and different nutritional resources, ensuring the quality of food has become a priority for humans to meet their nutritional needs and guarantee their well-being. In this study, we highlighted the physicochemical characteristics and nutritional value of squash pulp powder as a processed product of good nutritional quality. In preliminary studies, powders dried differently were examined for proximate compositions (moisture, ash, total sugar, fat, protein, pigments, vitamin A and mineral) and techno-functional properties. Besides its nutritional quality, pulp contains considerable amounts of total polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins. Accordingly, it has interesting antioxidant power (IC50 = 1.667 μg/mL), indicating rapid and immediate antioxidant activity. These nutritional values and the presence of phenolic compounds qualify this squash pulp powder as a functional and conservable food product. Sensory analysis of biscuits made from 15% squash confirmed the nutraceutical characterization of squash pulp as a useful alimentary additive favoring the marketing of processed agricultural products. All the results emphasize the interest in using dried squash pulp in the food processing industry given its nutritional richness and easy cultivation.",

Animal energetics has largely focused on beef cattle within confined systems such as feedlots. However, beef cattle grazing in extensive rangelands likely have a higher energetic requirement due to the need to forage across heterogeneous landscapes. In this study, we created a precision system model to account for net energy for activity of beef cattle on extensive rangeland systems by integrating in-pasture weighing technology, Global Positioning System (GPS) data, and animal nutrition models.

When choosing a specific RFP variant, the priority may be given to the fluorescence brightness, maturation rate, monomericity, excitation/emission wavelengths, and low toxicity, which are rarely combined in an optimal way in a single protein. If additional requirements such as prolonged fluorescence lifetime and/or blinking ability are applied, the available repertoire of probes could dramatically narrow. Since the entire diversity of conventional single-component RFPs belongs to just a few phylogenetic lines (DsRed-, eqFP578- and eqFP611-derived being the major ones), it is not unexpected that their advantageous properties are split between close homologs. In such cases, a systematic mutagenetic analysis focusing on variant-specific amino acid residues can shed light on the origins of the distinctness between related RFPs and may aid in consolidating their strengths in new RFP variants. For instance, the protein FusionRed, despite being efficient in fluorescence labeling thanks to its good monomericity and low cytotoxicity, has undergone considerable loss in fluorescence brightness/lifetime compared to the parental mKate2. In this contribution, we describe a fast-maturing monomeric RFP designed semi-rationally based on the mKate2 and FusionRed templates that outperforms both its parents in terms of molecular brightness, has extended fluorescence lifetime, and displays a spontaneous blinking pattern that is promising for nanoscopy use.",

D9 and B2 Mabs were raised against serotype O and tested against three more sets of peptides: (1) nine overlapping peptides with one amino acid difference, (2) alanine scanning peptide, both for O1K strain and (3) four mutated peptides one for A22 and three for SAT2 strains in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format with correlation to virus neutralisation test.\n\nThe D9 Mab was bound to peptides corresponding to the G-H loops of serotype O, A, and SAT1 strains, but only neutralised serotype O and SAT1 strains in the virus neutralisation test. The B2 Mab is also bound to serotype O and SAT1 but only neutralised serotype O. Using a set of overlapping peptides, the binding region for the D9 Mab was confirmed as amino acid positions 144, 147 and 148. An additional critical amino acid residue at position 145R was identified using a set of alanine scanning peptides. The binding region for B2 Mab appears to be upstream of RGD as B2 showed lower binding to peptides lacking the first three amino acids of the GH-loop peptides. These critical amino acids were further confirmed by designing modified SAT2 and A peptides at these positions, which led to a significant improvement in the binding ability of D9 but not B2.\n\nThese findings help to map cross-reactive epitopes within the G-H loop which may contribute to the inter-serotypic cross-reactivity observed in diagnostic serological assays giving insights that motivate the design of custom peptides that have improved serotype specificity.",

However, data on the prevalence and nutritional contributors to GI symptoms in Chinese recreational long distance runners remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, severity, and dietary influences of GI symptoms in this population.\n\nA total of 805 valid responses were collected through an online and offline questionnaire conducted in China between January and December 2024. Participants were recreational long distance runners recruited via running clubs, community organizations, sports associations, and online platforms. The questionnaire covered six areas: demographics, exercise habits, dietary strategies, GI symptom severity and frequency, influencing factors, and knowledge and attitudes. GI symptoms during races were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), which includes 11 symptoms rated on a 7-point Likert scale.\n\nNotably, 26.1% of participants reported GI symptoms during races, with bloating (18.6%), urge to defecate (17.8%), and stomach pain (16.5%) being the most frequent. Symptoms peaked in prevalence and severity during the middle phase of the race. GI symptoms were more common in males (27.9%) than females (20.8%), and runners aged 34 years and younger had a higher symptom rates. Nutritional factors, particularly pre- and mid-race dietary strategies, significantly influenced symptom occurrence. Foods high in fat, protein, fiber, or fermentable carbohydrates were commonly associated with GI distress. Eating within 30 min before a race increased the risk of bloating and urge to defecate. The use of energy gels, sports drinks, and hydration strategies also correlated with higher GI symptom risk. Other contributing factors included a history of GI issues and high monthly running volume.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of individualized dietary planning to reduce GI symptoms among recreational long distance runners. Adjusting pre-race meal timing and avoiding certain food types may mitigate discomfort. In addition to nutrition, variables such as sex, age, training load, and medical history should be considered in preventive strategies. Future research should explore tailored nutrition and training approaches to improve athlete health and performance during endurance events.",

Beyond its fundamental role in iron homeostasis, ferritin demonstrates growing application value in food engineering, nanocarrier systems, and biomedicine, owing to its unique self-assembly properties, exceptional stability, and biocompatibility. This review systematically summarizes the core structural features and physicochemical properties of ferritin, with a particular focus on its applications across three major domains. In food engineering, ferritin acts as both a carrier for bioactive compounds and a highly efficient, low-irritant iron fortificant, significantly enhancing nutrient stability, solubility, and bioavailability, thereby extending food shelf life. In the nanocarrier field, its nanocage structure provides an ideal platform for constructing nutrient and drug delivery systems, enabling targeted transport and controlled release. In biomedicine, ferritin is utilized in tumor imaging, targeted therapy, and inflammation biomarker detection. Using sturgeon liver ferritin as a specific example, this review details its unique advantages derived from its source, such as distinctive structure, enhanced stability, and application potential. Furthermore, the review identifies key challenges in ferritin research, including structural variability, digestive stability, and long-term safety concerns. It also outlines future research directions, highlighting the immense potential of ferritin in addressing critical challenges like fresh-cut food preservation. With advancing technology and multidisciplinary integration, ferritin is poised to become a powerful interdisciplinary tool.",

Endosymbionts are in host specialised cells, called the bacteriocytes, which in many insects group together to form a symbiotic organ, the bacteriome. The cereal weevil Sitophilus oryzae houses multiple bacteriomes at the adult mesenteric caeca.\n\nUsing microscopic cell imaging, we revealed that bacteriomes consist of several cell types, including progenitor cells, peripheral bacteriocytes, central bacteriocytes and epithelial cells. By combining laser capture microdissection and dual RNA-sequencing, we showed that both host cell types and their associated endosymbionts express distinct transcriptional profiles. The comparison between peripheral bacteriocytes and midgut cells from insects artificially deprived from endosymbionts (aposymbiotic) unravelled cellular pathways modulated by the presence of endosymbionts. The cell-specific response to endosymbionts in peripheral bacteriocytes includes a boost of fatty-acid and amino acid metabolisms. We found that central bacteriocytes overexpress transport and G-protein signalling-related genes when compared to peripheral bacteriocytes, indicating a signalling and/or transport function of these cells. Diet composition strongly impacts host and endosymbiont gene expression and reveals a molecular trade-off among metabolic pathways.\n\nThis study provides evidence on how endosymbionts interfere and enhance metabolic performances of insect bacteriocytes and highlights key genes involved in the bacteriocyte differentiation and metabolic pathways.

Choosing an appropriate diet is necessary to prevent the progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the effects of 3 diets, including intermittent fasting (IF) 5:2, portfolio-moderate-carbohydrate (PMC), and anti-inflammatory (AI) diets, compared to a healthy diet with carbohydrate distribution.\n\nThis open label randomized clinical trial was performed on 98 patients with pre-diabetes that were randomly divided into four intervention groups, including IF 5:2 (n = 24), PMC (n = 24), AI (n = 25), and control group (n = 25). Adherence to these dietary intervention was assessed by dietary recall. Glycemic indices (fasting blood sugar (FBS) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)), lipid profile, body composition, anthropometric indices (weight, waist circumference (WC), and body mass index (BMI)), and hs-C reactive protein (CRP) were assessed before and after dietary intervention. Mixed model regression was used for statistical analysis.\n\nCompared to the control group, the AI diet significantly reduced weight (β: -1.02; 95% CI: -1.96, -0.07; P = 0.017), FBS (β: -6.42; 95% CI: -12.9, -0.06; P = 0.026), and HbA1c (β: -0.27; 95% CI: -0.55, -0.007; P = 0.028). IF 5:2 showed significant reductions in waist circumference, BMI, FBS, and HbA1c, while PMC intervention resulted in significant improvements in FBS and HbA1c compared to the control group.\n\nThe study demonstrated that AI, IF 5:2, and PMC diets improved glycemic control and anthropometric indices in pre-diabetic patients, with the AI diet showing the greatest beneficial effects. These findings suggest that anti-inflammatory dietary approaches may be an effective strategy for pre-diabetes management.\n\nLevel I, randomized clinical trial.\n\nRegistration number IRCT20200608047697N2, data 2024-05-16, https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/trial/76653 .",

Due to the absence of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs, the slaughter of infected and exposed pigs is a current prevention and control measure. Early diagnosis is crucial for the management of ASFV, and the p15 protein plays a critical role in the maturation of ASFV particles.\n\nIn this study, a prokaryotic expression system obtained highly pure soluble p15 protein, and four monoclonal antibodies (3 C, 4B, 5D, 8 F) were prepared. These antibodies demonstrated the specific recognition of exogenously expressed p15. Antigenic epitopes were initially mapped using six overlapping p15 truncated proteins. Results showed that the epitopes of 3 C, 5D, and 8 F were all located in P49-N65, which is highly conserved among genotypes I, II, VII, IX, X, and XX. In contrast, 4B identified an epitope located at K105-R132, which was conserved only in genotypes I, II, and XX ASFV.\n\nThis study identified two novel conserved epitopes, P49-N65 and K105-R132. This provided valuable insights into the antigenic epitopes of ASFV p15 protein, contributing to a better understanding of its functional properties and demonstrating potential utility for the development of ASFV diagnostic tools.",

Since diabetes is highly prevalent in this population, it is crucial that such foods also have a low glycemic index (GI) to support glycemic control and reduce associated complications. This study aimed to assess the GI of selected commercial protein-free products.\n\nTwelve healthy volunteers (six males, six females; mean age 20.7 ± 0.8 years; BMI 22.6 ± 3.6 kg/m²) consumed four commonly available protein-free foods: sliced white bread, pasta, crackers, and cookies filled with vanilla cream (with sweeteners). The GI of each product was calculated according to ISO 2010 standards, using glucose as a reference. Each test meal provided 50 g of available carbohydrates.\n\nGI values ranged from 48 for cookies filled with vanilla cream to 69 for crackers. Sliced white bread (GI 49.4) and cookies (GI 47.8) were classified as low-GI foods, while pasta (GI 68.2) and crackers (GI 69.2) fell within the medium-GI range.\n\nSeveral commercially available protein-free products exhibit low to moderate GI values, supporting their use in dietary management of patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and or at risk of diabetes. However, given the growing market of such products, further studies-including those on patients with CKD-are needed to expand the current evidence base.",

Its pathology is closely linked to lipid metabolism disorders, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Dietary supplementation has recently emerged as a promising treatment strategy for MAFLD. Broccoli leaves, a by-product of broccoli, are rich in proteins, polysaccharides, polyphenols, flavonoids, and other bioactive compounds.\n\nThis study identified the active components in broccoli leaf crude extract (BLCE) using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and chemical methods, and confirmed its significant antioxidant activity through three in vitro assays. In oleic acid (OA)-induced HepG2 cells, BLCE attenuated the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), restored antioxidant markers (SOD, MDA, and GSH), and reduced intracellular total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells, BLCE significantly inhibited the production of inflammatory factors - tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) - demonstrating anti-inflammatory effects. In a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MAFLD mouse model, BLCE reversed MAFLD by lowering serum and liver lipids, restoring liver function, morphology, and organization, and reducing liver injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Finally, the study identified 487 intersecting genes and screened 20 core targets through network pharmacology. Enrichment analysis revealed that BLCE's anti-MAFLD effects mainly involve hormone regulation, the carboxylic acid metabolic process, and the cAMP signaling pathway. Moreover, molecular docking results showed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a central target, and key compounds in BLCE exhibit significant affinity and bind effectively, contributing to anti-MAFLD effects.\n\nBroccoli leaf crude extract may be an effective dietary supplement for alleviating MAFLD by suppressing hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

This study investigated the therapeutic potential of Ginkgolide B (GB), a bioactive component of Ginkgo biloba leaves, in ameliorating hyperlipidemia and explored its underlying mechanisms. Utilizing a high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rat model and lipidomics analysis, the study showed that GB significantly decreased serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein levels. Lipidomics revealed that GB reversed dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism, notably decreasing ceramides levels and increasing sphingomyelins, which are implicated in metabolic inflammation and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, GB activated PPARα, thereby enhancing fatty acid oxidation and upregulating the Nrf2 pathway to mitigate oxidative damage. These dual effects were validated in vitro using HepG2 cells, where GB reduced lipid accumulation and improved antioxidant defenses. Overall, these findings highlight GB as a promising therapeutic agent for hyperlipidemia by restoring sphingolipid homeostasis and targeting the interplay between lipid metabolism and oxidative stress.",

Therefore, in this paper, the composition of CCJ12 was analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS, and effects on bodyweight, metabolic (HDL, LDL, TG, leptin, adiponectin), cardiovascular risk (sE-selectin, C-reactive protein,), and inflammatory (MCP-1, TNF-alpha) factors were investigated in a rodent model. In CCJ12, > 700 compounds were identified by LC/MS and the amounts of javamide I/II, caffeine and chlorogenic acids were quantified by HPLC. For the animal study, rats were placed into three groups (each n = 10); (CG group (a control diet with water), FG group (a high fat diet with water), and FCG group (a high fat diet with CCJ12)) and the study was conducted for 20 weeks. The data showed no significant differences in water/food intakes between all three groups. However, the FG and FCG groups showed weight gain, in comparison to the CG group (P < 0.05). Also, the FG and FCG groups showed higher levels of LDL, TG, and leptin than the CG group (P < 0.05).

This network meta-analysis (NMA) systematically evaluates the impact of eight dietary patterns on cardiovascular risk markers. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing low-fat, Mediterranean, ketogenic, low-carbohydrate, high-protein, vegetarian, intermittent fasting, and DASH diets. A random-effects model analyzed mean differences (MD) in body composition (weight, BMI, waist circumference), lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C), glycemic markers (glucose), and blood pressure (systolic/diastolic). Dietary efficacy was ranked via Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) scores. Among 21 RCTs (1,663 participants), ketogenic (MD -10.5 kg, 95% CI -18.0 to -3.05; SUCRA 99) and high-protein diets (MD -4.49 kg, 95% CI -9.55 to 0.35; SUCRA 71) showed superior efficacy for weight reduction.

Minipigs have great potential as models for human diseases, warranting investigation of the performance of the Göttingen minipig as a model for obesity-associated meta-inflammation. Here, we fed 26 pigs a high-fat, fructose and cholesterol diet (HFFC) or a standard diet (SD) for 103 days, resulting in the HFFC group having a 45% higher body weight and 16% larger abdominal circumference by the end of the experiment. Meta-inflammation was shown in the HFFC group by elevated serum concentrations of the acute phase protein C-reactive protein for more than 60 days during development of obesity, accompanied by increased numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Additional obesity-related abnormalities included dyslipidemia, hepatosteatosis and transcriptional changes to genes related to inflammation and metabolism in circulating leukocytes, liver and visceral adipose tissue. Notably, the transcription of genes related to lipid metabolism, namely ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), was elevated in liver, visceral adipose tissue and circulating leukocytes (ABCA1 only) in the HFFC group compared with the SD group. The development of obesity was accompanied by endotoxemia, indicated by a 2.5-fold increase in serum lipopolysaccharide concentration in the HFFC group compared with the SD group, suggesting increased intestinal permeability. In conclusion, the described Göttingen minipig model convincingly links diet-induced obesity, meta-inflammation and endotoxemia, achieved by short-duration HFFC dieting.",

Many AMPs kill by destroying the target's cytoplasmic membrane using short-lived membrane perturbations. Contrastingly, protein toxins form large pores by stably assembling in the target membrane. Here we describe an AMP class termed TMcins (for transmembrane helix-containing bacteriocin), in which half of the AMP forms a transmembrane helix. This characteristic allows TMcin to assemble into stable and large oligomeric pores. The biosynthetic locus of TMcin, which was broadly active against Gram-positive bacteria, is distributed throughout two major bacterial phyla, yet bears no homology to previously reported bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters. Our discovery of an AMP class that achieves pore stability otherwise only found in protein toxins transforms our current understanding of AMP structure and function and underscores the continuing importance of phenotype-initiated investigations in uncovering wholly uncharacterized antimicrobials.",

The optimal detection conditions were determined by optimizing the composition of the mobile phase, and characteristic chromatographic peaks were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The specificity, repeatability, precision, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the method were assessed.

Shengbai Oral Liquid (SBOL), a TCM formula primarily composed of Epimedium brevicornu Maxim., has demonstrated clinical efficacy in managing chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced leukocytopenia. Nevertheless, its therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear.\n\nElucidate the mechanism of SBOL in treating chemotherapy-induced leukopenia.\n\nA leukopenia model in mice was established using cyclophosphamide (CTX). Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies were performed to investigate mechanistic effects of SBOL at the genetic, protein, and metabolic levels. A comprehensive approach integrating multi-omics and network pharmacology was then employed to predict potential targets and pathways underlying the effects of SBOL. Finally, experiments were performed to validate the underlying molecular mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets.\n\nSBOL (oral treatment for 18 days) significantly increased the white blood cell (WBC) count in the peripheral blood of mice with leukopenia. Additionally, SBOL can significantly increase the quantity and proliferative activity of bone marrow cells (BMCs). Further flow cytometry analysis showed that SBOL can increase the number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in BMCs. Specifically, it increased the populations of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), short term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs), and multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) within the HSPCs. What is more, SBOL can also reduce spleen index and reverse the compensatory increase of HSPCs in the spleen. Transcriptomic analysis indicated SBOL is involved in lipid metabolism and immune regulation, while proteomic analysis identified pathways related to leukocyte migration and chemotaxis. Metabolomic analysis highlighted arachidonic acid and amino acid metabolism. Multi-omics and network pharmacology studies have suggested that Pro-Platelet Basic Protein (PPBP), ALOXE3, and CCR1 are key targets. Experiments confirmed that SBOL significantly elevated levels of hematopoietic factors, including CXCL12, TGF-β1, IL-34, IL-5, and GM-CSF. Additionally, SBOL reversed the decreased expression of PPBP in BMCs and restored serum PPBP levels in these mice with leukopenia.\n\nSBOL significantly alleviates leukopenia induced by chemotherapy. It increases the bone marrow HSPCs counts and elevates serum hematopoietic factors levels in chemotherapy-treated mice, thereby restoring hematopoietic function and boosting WBCs counts.

Its origin is not fully understood. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) derive from ancestral infections of germinal cells and represent 8% of the human DNA. They are mostly inactive, but some can be activated. Their aberrant expressions are associated with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. HERV transcription is modulated by TRIM28 and SETDB1, which are also directly implicated in epigenetic processes and modulation of the immune response. We reported HERV overexpressions in CeD children at diagnosis. In the current prospective study, using a PCR real-time Taqman amplification assay, we explored the transcription levels of HERV-H-pol, -HERV-K-pol, and HERV-W-pol, of syncytin 1 (SYN1), SYN2, and HERV-W-env, as well as of TRIM28 and SETDB1 in the whole blood from 51 adults with CeD after years of good compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) as compared to healthy controls (HC) of similar age. The transcriptional levels of every HERV and of TRIM28/SETDB1 were significantly higher in CeD patients than in HC (constantly with p<0.0001). Positive correlations were found between the RNA levels of TRIM28 or SETDB1 and HERVs in CeD patients. The upregulation of HERVs, TRIM28, and SETDB1 and their positive correlations are suggestive clues of their contribution to the pathophysiology of CeD and might justify the persistent risk of developing, despite GFD, autoimmune diseases, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and cancers, all disorders characterized by enhanced HERV expressions and epigenetic alterations.",

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to tackle the progression of metabolic disorders with minimal adverse effects. EphB singaling had been validated in the progression of metabolic syndrome. We leveraged the resolved X-ray crystal structure of the hEphB1 kinase domain to introduce thienopyridine-based analogs (termed STA analogs) that showed potential pan-inhibitory profiles for EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4 with no inhibition for EphB3 tyrosine kinase singaling pathways. STA-013 inhibited EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4 tyrosine kinases selectively, as validated by a premier kinase profiling assay against 140 protein kinases, with no inhibitory profile against EphB3 tyrosine kinase. Systemic injections of STA-013 resulted in weight loss with significant reduction of fat mass and perseverance of lean mass. This was associated with significant improvement in glucose homeostasis, mitigation of insulin resistance, and inhibition of fatty liver in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. This was allied with modulation of respiratory exchange rates during the dark cycle, with no change in food intake. Additionally, STA-013 administration resulted in inhibiting the EphB phosphorylated signal, coupled with increased p-AKT/AKT signaling, to suggest insulin signaling activation. STA-013 showed an elevated signal for InsR-β, which reversed the effect of insulin on InsR degradation, allowing for the restoration of glucose homeostasis and mitigating insulin resistance.",

The chemical pathways leading to hazelnut oxidative rancidity have been well characterized and are faster on free fatty acids. Lipase(s) enzymes are required in oilseeds to hydrolyse the ester bonds to free the single molecule of fatty acids. This step, necessary for germination, is the first event that triggers rancidity. Identifying the lipase(s) in hazelnuts and the biochemical pathways involved in rancidity would lead to an effective strategy to prevent fat deterioration. Different proteins have been characterized in hazelnut seed and great interest has been risen towards the non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) family because they were identified as human allergens. Here we show that Cor a 8 - a member of nsLTPs - is a novel non-regiospecific lipase able to bind to oil-water interfaces and hydrolyse the triacylglycerol (TAG) ester bonds by a non-canonical active site (non-serine dependent). Molecular modelling and molecular dynamics suggest that Cor a 8 is not only able to catalyse the hydrolysis of TAGs but also to stabilize the resulting free fatty acids within the active site. Cor a 8 homologues are present in all land plants, but the specific catalytic amino acids are found only in angiosperms, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for lipid metabolism unique to flowering plants. This study sets the foundation for understanding this new lipid metabolism in plants and its role in rancidity development.",

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of YG against V. alginolyticus were determined as 50 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL, respectively. Oxford cup assays revealed concentration-dependent antibacterial effects, with inhibition zones ranging from 6.03 mm to 14.86 mm.

Feeding trials demonstrated that dietary supplementation with YG enhanced immune enzyme activities, including lysozyme, catalase, and nitric oxide synthase, in sea cucumber coelomic fluid. Growth performance parameters such as specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) improved significantly with YG supplementation. In a bacterial challenge experiment, cumulative survival rates increased to 53.33% in the YG-treated groups compared to the positive control.

We present a new metalloproteomics method based on three dimensions of metal-free liquid chromatography (HPLC) hyphenated online with inductively coupled sector-field mass spectrometry (ICP-sfMS): anion exchange chromatography (AEC) followed by either chromatofocusing (CF) or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and finally size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We used this 3D technique to purify naturally abundant metalloproteins from crude extracts mainly from plants but also from bacteria to a quantity and purity sufficient for protein identification and quantification by mass spectrometry (Tims-TOF-MS). Protein mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD056024. Sensitivity and signal/background ratio were sufficient to identify proteins at concentrations <1 nM and total amounts <1 pmol in the final SEC.

We evaluated four dietary treatments: a control (CTR) and three experimental diets, each containing 15 % Spirulina: unprocessed (SP), extruded (SPE) and extruded plus 0.21 % enzyme blend (SPEM). Hepatic proteomic profiling identified 25 proteins whose abundance differed significantly (P < 0.05) among treatments. Proteins decreased in all Spirulina-fed groups were predominantly involved in lipid and amino-acid metabolism: hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, homocysteine-binding protein, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1, 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthase and aspartate aminotransferase. Conversely, proteins increased with Spirulina inclusion were mainly associated with carbohydrate catabolism and mitochondrial energy production: fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, multiple NADH dehydrogenase subunits (α, β, 75 kDa), and the voltage-dependent anion channel protein. Importantly, the magnitude of these proteomic shifts was greatest in the SPE and SPEM groups, indicating that extrusion enhances algal cell-wall disruption and nutrient accessibility, while supplemental enzymes further liberate bioactive components. This metabolic reprogramming suggests a shift in the broiler liver toward enhanced glycolytic flux and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Such adaptations may underpin improvements in hepatic function, support more efficient growth performance and bolster overall metabolic health in poultry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that targeted processing of Spirulina can selectively modulate the avian liver proteome, offering a promising strategy for functional feed design.",

Nonetheless, their limited stability and bioavailability present significant challenges to practical applications. To enhance the thermal stability, storage stability, and simulated digestion of ACN, we utilized whey protein isolate nanofibrils-casein (CA) complexes (WPCA) and WPCA- fucoidan (FD) glycated conjugates (WPCA-FD), as developed in our previous study, to formulate ACN-loaded complexes. These complexes, referred to as Complex I (ACN@CA), Complex II (ACN@WPCA), and Complex III (ACN@WPCA-FD), were synthesized using ultrasonic treatment. The average particle sizes of these complexes were determined to be 102.1 nm, 175.5 nm, and 365.3 nm, respectively. The ACN encapsulation efficiency of Complex III (59.47 %) increased almost 18 % than Complex I, while Complex III had the highest zeta potential (-35.25 mV). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that the surface of Complex III displayed an increased overall size and distinct morphological features, characterized by a uniform, regularly spherical shape with a relatively smooth texture. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy verified that the formation of complexes was facilitated by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, with a notable hydrogen bond interaction occurring between ACN and WPCA-FD. Furthermore, the protective effect (thermal and storage stability) of Complex III was more significant, showed slower ACN release in simulated releasing environment in vitro. This study demonstrated significant potential for enhancing the applicability of stabilizing anthocyanin in developmental processes.",

This review aims to evaluate current evidence and identify knowledge gaps regarding nutrition therapy for physical function and muscle mass, based on 17 systematic reviews developed for the Japanese Critical Care Nutrition Guideline 2024.\n\nLiterature searches were performed in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and ICHUSHI until April 2023, with additional searches up to September 2024. Studies were categorized by nutritional intervention and key findings were summarized.\n\nOverfeeding-of both energy and protein-increased adverse outcomes including impaired physical function. Excessive energy restriction also impaired physical outcomes, even during the hyperacute phase. Although adequate energy intake is physiologically necessary during recovery phases, most studies did not report nutritional intake during this period. Protein intake above the standard level helped preserve muscle mass. Nutrition therapy combined with early rehabilitation appears to support physical function. Under the equivalent energy intake, the route and method of administration had minimal impact, but can help ensure adequate delivery. The effects of specific nutrients remain unclear due to limited studies and insufficient or unreported energy intake. Nevertheless, omega-3 fatty acids, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and synbiotics showed potential benefits.\n\nAlthough overfeeding may be harmful during the hyperacute phase, adequate energy intake, at least in the late period of the acute phase and subsequent phases, could play an important role in supporting the recovery of muscle mass and physical function. This approach may enhance the effectiveness of nutritional interventions in improving physical outcomes.",

The experimental design involved 96 pens, 12 per block and eight blocks, with each pen within block receiving one of 12 dietary treatments for one week. Treatment diets, varying in amino acid concentrations, starch, and energy densities, were control-fed. The weights of processing body parts and net energy for gain (NEg) were determined with Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry, and fed heat production, fasting heat production (FHP), and net energy for maintenance (NEm) with calorimetry chambers. N-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) was determined. PE was calculated as NEg + NEm, and classic net energy (CNE) as AMEn - heat increment (heat increment = fed heat production - FHP).

Given the rising prevalence of environmental toxicants and their potential impact on maternal health, it is imperative to explore the relationship between environmental exposures and GDM. This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) in this context, demonstrating that exposure to environmental toxicants may influence GDM risk through some pathways. Data from the 2007-2020 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed to assess the association between exposure to 89 environmental toxicants and GDM incidence. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to identify toxicant-GDM associations, with a particular concentration on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and certain metals. Additionally, network pharmacology approaches were employed to predict candidate molecular targets of VOCs and elucidate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) linked to GDM pathophysiology. The Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) and STRING databases were utilized to construct a PPI network. The findings revealed that 29 environmental toxicants exhibited a positive association with GDM, notably among VOCs and selected metals. HDL-C emerged as a potential surrogate marker for systemic inflammation, mediating the correlation between toxicant exposure and GDM risk. Network pharmacology analysis further revealed key pathways and protein targets implicated in the relationship between environmental exposures and GDM pathogenesis. These findings highlight the critical role of environmental toxicants in shaping maternal health outcomes and GDM susceptibility. By identifying HDL-C as a mediator, this study offers novel insights into the inflammatory mechanisms driving GDM development. Public health strategies must prioritize addressing environmental toxicant exposure to reduce GDM risk and improve maternal-fetal health outcomes.",

However, the functional roles of HD-ZIP subfamily II genes, particularly in pepper (Capsicum annuum), remain inadequately studied, and their involvement in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling is not fully elucidated. In this study, we isolated the HD-ZIP subgroup II gene CaDRHB12 (C. annuum drought-responsive homeobox gene 12), which shares sequence homology with CaHAT1, a previously identified positive regulator of drought tolerance. Unlike that of CaHAT1, CaDRHB12 expression was significantly downregulated upon ABA and drought stress treatment. Functional analyses of CaDRHB12 in pepper and Arabidopsis plants revealed that CaDRHB12 negatively regulates ABA signalling and drought stress responses. Furthermore, CaDRHB12 interacted with CaSnRK2.6, an ABA signalling-related kinase that associates with and phosphorylates CaHAT1. In vitro and in vivo kinase assays demonstrated that CaSnRK2.6 also directly phosphorylates CaDRHB12, promoting CaDRHB12 protein degradation. This degradation was not observed in CaDRHB12 phospho-dead and CaSnRK2.6 kinase-dead mutants. Additionally, the transcriptional activity of CaDRHB12 was influenced by its phosphorylation status and CaSnRK2.6 function, highlighting the critical role of CaSnRK2.6-mediated phosphorylation in regulating CaDRHB12 protein. Collectively, our findings suggest that CaDRHB12 negatively regulates pepper drought tolerance, and its protein stability is modulated by CaSnRK2.6-mediated phosphorylation under drought stress conditions. Understanding the role of CaDRHB12 in drought stress response aids in developing strategies to improve plant resilience to abiotic stresses, potentially leading to more robust crops.",

Laboratory experiments in this field are often expensive, and therefore large-scale computational protein inference from readily available amino acid sequences is needed to understand in more detail the mechanisms underlying biological processes in living organisms. Recently, studies have utilised mathematical ideas from natural language processing and self-supervised learning, to derive features based on protein sequence information. In the area of language modelling, it has been shown that learnt representations from self-supervised pre-training can capture the semantic information of words well for downstream applications. In this study, we tested the ability of sequence-based protein representations learnt using self-supervised pre-training on a large protein database, on multiple protein inference tasks. We show that simple baseline representations in the form of bag-of-words histograms perform better than those based on self-supervised learning, on sequence similarity and protein inference tasks. By feature selection we show that the top discriminant features help bag-of-words capture important information for data-driven function prediction. These findings could have important implications for self-supervised learning models on protein sequences, and might encourage the consideration of alternative pre-training schemes for learning representations that capture more meaningful biological information from the sequence alone.",

The most common form is associated with auto-antibodies to leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) protein, the presentation of which includes frequent focal seizures. The exact cause of these auto-antibodies remains unknown, but established predispositions include overrepresented human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Yet, these HLA alleles are themselves common in the healthy ancestry-matched population. One potential etiological hypothesis is that an environmental trigger, such as the gut microbiome, interacts with a genetically predisposed individual.\n\nTo investigate this, we studied 42 patients with LGI1-antibody encephalitis (LGI1-Ab-E) and 27 familial/environmentally matched controls, and performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing, to describe the compositional and functional differences in the gut microbiome.\n\nWe observed that LGI1-Ab-E gut microbiomes exhibited a significant reduction in the ratio of Firmicutes (or Bacillota) and Bacteroidetes phyla, which is associated with the dosage of HLA susceptibility allele count in patients with LGI1-Ab-E. Furthermore, we identified differences in functional gene profiles in the gut microbiome that led to a reduction of neuroinflammatory protective short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in LGI1-Ab-E patients.\n\nTaken together, our results suggest that a compositional shift in the gut microbiome of LGI1-Ab-E associates with a neuroinflammatory state, possibly through the reduction of SCFA production. Our study highlights the potential of the gut microbiome to explain some of the complex condition and unravel etiological questions. Validation studies with greater sample sizes are recommended.",

Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analysis showed that HcN13 is expressed in the dorsal epithelial cells of the mantle center, indicating that HcN13 is a shell nacreous layer matrix protein. The expression of HcN13 in the mantle significantly increased during the regeneration of the prismatic and nacreous layers. Furthermore, the suppression of HcN13 at both the transcriptional and protein levels resulted in the complete destruction of the prisms and nacre tablets in vivo. However, the addition of SUMO-HcN13 did not affect the polymorphism and morphology of the crystals in vitro. These results indicated that HcN13 may serve as a modulator that influences downstream signaling pathways to further regulate shell formation. Additionally, HcN13 was highly expressed in hemocytes during pearl nacre disorder deposition and was also highly expressed in the mantle during pearl nacre order deposition, indicating that HcN13 is essential for pearl biomineralization.

The present study evaluated the immunological potential of the proteins MPT83 and MPT51 for vaccine production, comparing them with MPT64. To do this, the sequences of these proteins from MTB H37Rv were downloaded and analyzed. The prediction of T and B cell epitopes was performed, and the adjuvant (50 S L7/L12) was included in the fusion of MPT83 and MPT51 to enhance the immune response. The allergenicity, antigenicity, solubility and physicochemical properties of the fused protein fragments were evaluated. Through different programs, a variety of bioinformatics tools were used to predict, analyze and validate the tertiary structure. The results of the in silico immunological simulation of the chimeric protein demonstrated that the best region for use as an epitope is the initial part of MPT83, consisting of 100 amino acid residues, and the final portion of MPT51, consisting of 99 amino acid residues, with a significant immunological response, excellent antigenicity (1.02) and no allergenicity. The secondary structure revealed that the majority of alpha-helices are in the initial part of the proteins, and the chimeric vaccine has 3 beta strands along its length.

PPs are a diverse group of plant-derived secondary metabolites with recognized anti-obesogenic potential. While their inhibitory effects on adipogenesis are well established, their role in modulating lipid metabolism in fully differentiated adipocytes remains less well understood. Emerging evidence from studies on mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes indicates that PPs can influence key metabolic processes, including lipid storage and mobilization.

    "combined_text": "Serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 3 orchestrates glucocorticoid signaling to facilitate chromatin remodeling during murine adipogenesis.\n\nElevated glucocorticoid (GC) levels are common in conditions such as aging, chronic stress, Cushing syndrome, and GC therapy. While GCs suppress inflammation through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), they also cause metabolic side effects. Investigating alternative pathways beyond GR activation is crucial for reducing these side effects. Our phosphoproteomics analysis revealed that glucocorticoid exposure promotes phosphorylation at the RxxS motifs of multiple proteins in preadipocytes, including those mediated by Serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 3 (SGK3). SGK3 is a key mediator of glucocorticoid-induced adipogenesis, as shown by impaired adipogenesis following SGK3 inhibition or genetic ablation. Sgk3 knockout mice were resistant to glucocorticoid- or high-fat diet-induced obesity, and PROTAC targeting SGK3 reduced adipogenesis in both obese mice and a thyroid eye disease cell line. Mechanistically, SGK3 translocated to the nucleus upon glucocorticoid stimulation, interacted with and phosphorylated the BRG1 subunit of the BAF complex, and prevented BRG1 degradation, promoting chromatin remodeling necessary for adipogenesis. These findings highlight SGK3 as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate metabolic side effects of elevated glucocorticoid levels.",

    "combined_text": "Effects of ageing and exercise training on cerebrovascular vasomotor reactivity, depressive behaviour and the hippocampal transcriptome.\n\nThe ageing global population is experiencing an increased prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke and dementia. This highlights a need for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of age-related cerebrovascular alterations, alongside benefits of interventions such as physical activity. Therefore, our aims were to: (1) examine the impact of ageing and exercise training on cerebrovascular function and (2) to characterize age- and exercise training-related changes in the hippocampus transcriptome. Young and old male rats were randomized to a sedentary condition or exercise training for 10 weeks. In the first protocol, cerebral arteries were isolated to test vasomotor reactivity, quantify gene/protein expression and assess nitric oxide production. In the second protocol, anhedonia was assessed and hippocampal tissue collected for RNA-sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses (i.e. protein-protein interaction mapping) were performed. Ageing impaired endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity in the posterior communicating artery (PCoA), with a shift from endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS)- to neuronal NOS-mediated vasorelaxation, as well as alterations in oxidative stress production. In support, PCoA superoxide-mediated vasoreactivity and neuronal NOS-mediated production of NO decreased with age. Exercise enhanced vasodilatation in young rats, but the results suggested reduced cerebrovascular plasticity in older animals. In the second protocol, exercise training attenuated the age-related increase in anhedonia behaviour. Hippocampal RNA-sequencing revealed altered inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways with ageing that were mitigated by exercise training. Our findings underscore the complex interplay between vascular/neuronal factors in the ageing brain. Furthermore, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of exercise in mitigating the adverse effects of ageing on cerebral health. KEY POINTS: Ageing is associated with increased risks of cerebrovascular disease and neurocognitive decline. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms involved in this process, limiting our ability to design appropriate interventions. Ageing is associated with alterations in cerebrovascular function, including possible changes in the mechanisms underlying vasomotor reactivity. Hippocampal RNA-seq revealed age-related alterations in neuronal, vascular, immune and oxidative-stress related signalling pathways. Exercise training may have mitigated many of these age-related changes, suggesting that enhancing physical activity may be a feasible means to preserve cerebral health in older individuals.",

Studying the mitochondrial ATP synthase in primary hippocampal neurons and their released EVs, we discovered that the abundance of ATP synthase in NEVs echoes the catalytic activity level of ATP synthase in neurons. We also observed, unexpectedly, that within the neuron, the quantity of ATP synthase remains constant irrespective of the level of its activity. Using non-canonical amino acid tagging coupled with proximity ligation assay, we found that the amount of nascent ATP synthase is linearly correlated to its activity, which may contribute to maintaining the overall quantity of ATP synthase in the neuron stable. Furthermore, we identified a sub-population of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) that carry ATP synthase and are not targeted to lysosomal degradation. Our findings suggest a strategy used by neurons in regulating and fine-tuning mitochondrial ATP synthase through MDV and NEV generation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between ATP synthase-containing-NEVs and -MDVs.",

High-fat diets (HFD) disrupt glucose and lipid metabolism and promote ectopic lipid deposition, leading to renal lipotoxicity and dysfunction. We recently reported that grape pomace extract (GPE), rich in phenolic compounds, has beneficial effects on obesity-related metabolic disorders. This study investigates whether GPE supplementation could revert or attenuate HFD-induced renal damage in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard diet (16% calories from fat) or HFD (60% calories from fat) with or without GPE (300 mg per kg body weight per day) for 16 weeks. Chronic consumption of HFD induced several obesity-related alterations such as increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT), insulin resistance, dyslipidemia along with altered markers of kidney function (higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and kidney protein levels of Kim-1). This was associated with increased kidney lipid accumulation, glomerular and tubular injury and fibrosis. Supplementation with GPE mitigated all these adverse effects. GPE protected kidney function by modulating cell signals involved in energy metabolism (p-AMPK/p-ACC), inflammation (NLRP3/caspase-1/NF-κB/TNF-α pathway) and oxidative stress (oxidant species production and Nox4 downregulation). These findings support the use of grape-derived bioactive compounds, to counteract obesity-related renal injury.",

The original mass offset searches were closer to open search, lacking the ability to restrict modifications to specific amino acids. Here, we describe a new \"detailed\" mass offset (DMO) search implemented in the MSFragger search engine, which allows each mass offset to have its own site restrictions and fragmentation rules. The benefits of DMO search over existing mass offset searches are shown with three example searches of complex modification sets: nearly one hundred post-translational modifications, fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP)-derived modifications, and amino acid substitutions. The DMO search further improves the interpretability of results by reducing ambiguity in site localization, particularly when modifications have overlapping masses, and provides benefits that scale with the complexity of the search.",

Here, we explored the impact of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on the phenotypic transition of VSMCs. Our findings revealed that FGF21 expression was substantially down-regulated in both human and mouse neointimal regions. Additionally, plasma FGF21 levels were lower in patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (ASCAD) compared to those without ASCAD. Similarly, patients with restenosis exhibited reduced FGF21 levels compared to those without restenosis. In vivo, FGF21 deficiency accelerated intimal hyperplasia and decreased the number of contractile VSMCs in mouse neointima. However, hepatocyte-specific FGF21 knockout had no effect on ligation-induced intimal hyperplasia. Conversely, administration of recombinant FGF21 protein reduced neointima formation. This effect was abolished in mice with β-klotho VSMC-specific knockout, suggesting a direct effect of FGF21 on VSMCs. In vitro, FGF21 could promote the contractile phenotype transition of human aortic smooth muscle cells under basal or platelet-derived growth factor-BB incubation conditions. Furthermore, FGF21 activation led to the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which subsequently formed a complex with the serum response factor (SRF)-myocardin complex. This complex increased the phosphorylation of SRF at serine 224, thereby enhancing the transcription activation of the SRF-myocardin complex. Finally, we revealed that treatment with the FGF21 analog efruxifermin or activation of p38 MAPK using anisomycin effectively inhibited neointima formation.

We aimed to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of the FFQ over an expanded area of Japan.

We evaluated reproducibility and validity by comparing the intakes of 27 nutrients between the two FFQs and the first FFQ (FFQ1) and WDRs, respectively. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (SRs) between estimates from the FFQs and WDRs were calculated and corrected for intra-individual variation in the WDRs.

The energy-adjusted SRs ranged from 0.20 (protein) to 0.71 (alcohol) for women, and the median was 0.43. The FFQ demonstrated high reproducibility and moderate validity, which suggests that it is appropriate to clarify associations between diet and health and/or disease among adults in Japan.",

Various studies have demonstrated that traditional Chinese medicine alleviates MAFLD by suppressing PANoptosis. Although Oridonin (ORI) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used in hepatosteatosis, its underlying mechanism for treating MAFLD, especially regarding PANoptosis, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the ameliorative effects of ORI on MAFLD by inhibiting PANoptosis and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. A vivo model of MAFLD was constructed by feeding mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. ORI was simultaneously intragastric gavaged for 12 weeks. A vitro model of MAFLD was constructed by palmitic acid (PA) induced AML12 cells for 24 h; ORI was simultaneously induced for 24 h. Extraction of mice plasma for detecting lipid-related and oxidative stress-related assay kits was performed. Lipid metabolism and PANoptosis-related proteins and pathways were validated both in vivo and in vitro through western blotting and immunofluorescence. The functions of the candidate proteins were further investigated using the plasmid transfection technique. Then the Biotin labeling assays were used to analyze the proteins' direct interaction with ORI. ORI treatment significantly alleviated HFD-induced inflammation and PANoptosis. Likewise, ORI effectively attenuated PANoptosis induced by PA in the AML12 cells. Additionally, over-expression of NLRP3, which is a key component in PANoptosis, could partly antagonize the inhibiting effects of ORI on steatosis and PANoptosis. Next, our findings demonstrated the increased NLRP3 acetylation level in PA-induced cells, while ORI treatment decreased the NLRP3 acetylation level. Further studies revealed that ORI could bind to and activate SIRT2 to increase the protein expression and stability of SIRT2, which in turn deacetylated and inactivated NLRP3. Moreover, over-expression of NLRP3 could partly antagonize the inhibiting effects of ORI on lipid droplet deposition and PANoptosis, which could be rescued by over-expression of SIRT2. Therefore, these findings show that ORI can alleviate MAFLD by suppressing PANoptosis via inhibiting the SIRT2/NLRP3 pathway. These findings provide new therapeutic targets and mechanisms for the treatment of MAFLD.",

Hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) functions as a receptor for various diet-derived metabolites. Although a growing body of evidence indicates these metabolites exert beneficial effects on depression, the precise mechanisms underlying these benefits require further investigation.\n\nWe established a mouse model of corticosterone (Cor)-induced depression to evaluate the therapeutic potential of HCAR2 activation on depression. A series of behavioral experiments were conducted to investigate whether HCAR2 activation could alleviate depressive-like behaviors in mice. The neuroprotective effects of HCAR2 in the hippocampus were examined using Nissl and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in mouse serum were quantified, as well as the cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of hippocampal neurons co-cultured with primary microglia. Microglia-associated neuroinflammation was evaluated by quantifying pro-inflammatory cytokines using ELISA, and by assessing the polarization state of M1 microglia, including the mRNA expression levels of M1 markers and double fluorescence staining for inducible nitric oxide synthase/ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (iNOS/Iba1). The expression level of proteins in the protein kinase B-inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunits alpha and beta-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (AKT-IKKαβ-NFκB) pathway in primary microglia was analyzed using western blot. Transcriptomic changes in microglia induced by HCAR2 activation were examined through RNA sequencing. Mice were fed PLX5622 chow to deplete microglia\n\nActivation of HCAR2 by its agonist MK-6892 in a Cor-induced model of depression significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors, attenuated hippocampal neuronal injury, increased serum monoamine levels, reduced microglia-associated neuroinflammation, and inhibited the expression of proteins in the AKT-IKKαβ-NFκB pathway in primary microglia. Additionally, HCAR2 activation markedly enhanced hippocampal neuronal viability and decreased LDH activity in this co-culture system. Importantly, these protective effects were abolished in HCAR2 knockout mice. RNA sequencing revealed that HCAR2 activation induced changes in multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the depletion of microglia also eliminated the protective effects of MK-6892.\n\nActivation of HCAR2 can reduce depressive-like behaviors, neuronal injury, and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest these neuroprotective effects are, at least in part, mediated through modulation of microglial activity by HCAR2.",

Proximate analyses, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-flame ionization detector (GC-MS-FID) profiling of phytochemicals, and in vitro antioxidants potentials of VBS and FVBS were determined using established protocols. Diabetes was induced via intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg) in Wistar rats, and animals with blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL, which were diabetic, were treated with high-fat diet (HFD) containing varied proportions of FVBS (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) and HFD+ metformin (100 mg/kg) for 21 days.

In view of the rising burden of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and CKD on a global scale, there is currently a great need for drugs that can effectively prevent the onset and reverse or slow down the progression of CKD in diverse patient populations. Over the last decades, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can exert cardioprotective and nephroprotective actions.

However, little is known about their effects on the immune function of the animals. In the present investigation, mealworm meal was included in two complete diets with either a moderate or a high protein concentration (3.47% or 5.45% nitrogen in dry matter). Two diets with comparable protein levels (3.66% and 5.17% nitrogen in dry matter), but based on poultry by-product meal, served as control treatments. The diets were offered to 10 healthy adult beagle dogs, using a randomized crossover design. Each diet was fed for 4 weeks.

    "combined_text": "Sitosterolemia carrying both ABCG5 and HBA gene mutations: a case report and review of the literature.\n\nMutations in the ABCG5 gene can cause sitosterolemia, which is a rare lipid metabolism disorder characterized by impaired regulation of phytosterols, leading to their excessive accumulation in tissues and organs, which triggers various complications. If left untreated, it may cause serious issues, often presenting first as xanthomas on the skin and other tissues.\n\nA 9-year-old female Chinese Zhuang patient developed her first xanthomas on her knees at the age of 4, which progressively spread across her body over the years. Initial blood tests revealed elevated plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, and she was misdiagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia, leading to ineffective treatment. Despite visiting several hospitals, the underlying cause remained unidentified, and the patient was eventually admitted to our hospital for further evaluation. The complete blood count showed mild hypochromic microcytic anemia and blood smears showed microcytic hypochromic anemia and the presence of giant platelets in the peripheral blood. Plasma phytosterol profiling revealed significantly elevated phytosterol levels, and whole exome sequencing detected a homozygous mutation in the ABCG5 gene (c.751C > T, p.Q251*). On the basis of these findings, the patient was diagnosed with sitosterolemia. Her parents and younger brother were found to carry the heterozygous mutation but exhibited no clinical symptoms. In addition, iron metabolism tests and DNA copy number multidetection technology, along with single nucleotide polymorphism typing, revealed that the patient also had a silent alpha-thalassemia trait (genotype: HBA, -α3.7/αα).\n\nSitosterolemia is a rare lipid metabolism disorder that should be considered in patients presenting with multiple xanthomas, severe hypercholesterolemia, or elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Diagnosis can be confirmed through phytosterol detection and molecular testing. Early diagnosis allows for dietary recommendations-such as restricting cholesterol and phytosterol intake-and, if necessary, treatment with medications such as ezetimibe. As we know, alpha-thalassemia is able to cause microcytosis and phytosterolemia may cause stomatocytosis in peripheral blood. However, there are no reports of two gene mutations occurring simultaneously in the same individual, and no stomatocytosis was observed in our patient. Hence, this suggests that the mutual regulation of two diseases and the effects on red blood cell membranes may exist, and the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon are valuable for further research.",

Anti-biofilm activity was further confirmed using scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses identified significant changes in 366 genes and 286 metabolites after treatment. Integrated omics analysis suggested that the extract impaired cell membrane and wall integrity, disrupted amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism, inhibited the TCA cycle, reduced nitrate reductase activity, suppressed efflux systems, and hindered biofilm formation.\n\nThe study provides new insights into the antibacterial and anti-biofilm mechanisms of Rhizoma Coptidis extract against S. epidermidis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for combating biofilm-associated infections.",

Studies have identified a potential link between cardiovascular disease and LBMD, and the role of lipid metabolism in this has attracted widespread attention. We analyzed participant information collected from multiple NHANES cycles using weighted multivariable logistic regression, subgroup analysis, restricted cubic splines (RCS) curve analysis, and causal mediation analysis. Non-high-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein ratio (NHHR) was significantly negatively associated with low bone mass disorders in a fully adjusted model. We found that NHHR exhibited an L-shaped relationship with the prevalence of LBMD, with a negative association when NHHR < 3.38 and no significant association when NHHR > 3.38. So we could manage both disorders through NHHR. Causal mediation analysis demonstrated that NHHR was a partial mediator of the effect of body mass index (BMI) on low bone mass disorders (LBMD), accounting for 2.3% of the total effect. This suggests that part of the effect in weight affecting low bone mass disorders is mediated by the NHHR. This inspires us to utilize NHHR to guide weight management.",

Sows were fed a diet supplemented with 11 g/kg of inulin during early gestation and were slaughtered on gestation day 19 (G19).

Bioinformatics analysis revealed that inulin significantly downregulated miRNAs associated with angiogenesis inhibition in UFEs, while upregulating miRNAs related to trophoblast physiological activities and regulation of the uterine fluid microenvironment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, intravenous injection of G19 sows with UFEs from sows fed a diet containing inulin had significantly promoted vascular formation in the endometrium and embryos, and increased the number of live embryos on gestation day 28 (G28) (P < 0.05).

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce bioactive compounds, known as postbiotics, that act as promising natural preservatives with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial spectrum, production dynamics, and physicochemical properties of postbiotics derived from five LAB strains: Lactobacillus plantarum NBRC 3070, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ATCC 27673. The antimicrobial activity of these postbiotics was assessed against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. A crude bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS), a postbiotic component, was partially purified using ammonium sulfate purification and characterized enzymatically. Its molecular weight was estimated by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that postbiotics, particularly those from L. plantarum and L. acidophilus, exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The inhibitory effect was most pronounced against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus after a 16-h exposure. The postbiotics production peaked between 24 and 36 h of incubation, achieving 85.71-89.28% inhibition. These postbiotics remained stable at high temperatures (up to 121 °C), across a wide pH range (3-5 and 9-11), and under varying salt concentrations. Neutralized cell-free supernatants from L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. rhamnosus GG retained antimicrobial activity, and enzyme treatments confirmed the proteinaceous nature of the BLIS. SDS-PAGE revealed diffuse protein bands between < 3.3 and 6.5 kDa. Lyophilization enhanced the concentration and stability of antibacterial compounds by reducing water content. In addition to BLIS, LAB strains produced other antimicrobial metabolites, including lactic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, fatty acids, and notably, oleic acid. These postbiotic components remained effective after one month of storage at 4 °C and 20 °C for one month. The novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive characterization of postbiotics from well-established LAB strains across multiple functional parameters. Overall, the findings suggest that these LAB-derived postbiotics are stable, effective, and hold potential as natural antimicrobial agents in food preservation.",

One of these sites has recently been reported to be critical for binding EEEV to the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), an EEEV receptor protein. The proteins apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) isoforms 1 and 2, and LDLR have also been shown to function as EEEV receptors. Herein, we investigate the individual contribution of each HS interaction site to EEEV HS- and protein receptor-dependent infection in vitro and EEEV replication in animals. We show that each site contributes to both EEEV-HS and EEEV-protein receptor interactions, providing evidence that altering these interactions can affect disease in mice and eliminate mosquito infectivity. Thus, multiple HS-binding sites exist in EEEV E2, and these sites overlap functionally with protein receptor interaction sites, with each type of interaction contributing to tissue infectivity and disease phenotypes.",

However, few materials possess the function. β-amino acid polymers have demonstrated cell adhesion property, easy preparation, and robust stability to resist proteolysis as emerging biomaterials. Here, we develop amphiphilic β-amino acid polymers that demonstrate exceptional osteoblast vs fibroblast selectivity, outperforming the natural osteoblast-selective KRSR peptide. The optimal polymer selectively supports osteoblast adhesion by manipulating the adsorption of serum proteins and the presentation of RGD motifs on polymer-modified surfaces. In vivo study using polymer-modified titanium-implants in female rat maxillary bone reveals that the optimal polymer substantially promotes osseointegration of titanium-implants compared to uncoated titanium-implants, which tend to develop fibrous encapsulation. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy in designing osteoblast-selective biomaterials and implies the promising application of β-amino acid polymer as emerging osteoblast-selective biomaterials to promote osseointegration.",

Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING Finger Domains 1 (UHRF1) is an important epigenetic regulatory protein involved in regulating cellular life processes, developing many diseases. However, its potential role in regulating embryonic vascular development and postnatal angiogenesis is unclear. Our study found that endothelial cell-specific UHRF1 knockout mice showed obvious developmental disorders at the embryonic stage (E11.5-15.5), including impaired development of the individual embryo size and organs, sparse vascularity in the yolk sac, or even death. In the lower limb ischemia model, UHRF1 expression in ischemic muscle tissues of mice is proportionate to the regeneration of blood vessels. To confirm the specific inhibition of UHRF1, we transfected an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 which inserted a TIE-2 promoter and mediated the delivery of short hairpin RNA (AAV9-TIE-2-shUHRF1) into mouse vascular endothelial cells to knock down UHRF1 specifically. We observed that the knockdown of UHRF1 in endothelial cells results in poorer lower limb perfusion in mice. Mechanically, UHRF1 knockdown decreased the tube-forming capacity of ECFCs, whereas overexpression of UHRF1 by diabetic ECFCs where UHRF1 expression is typically downregulated significantly increased the tube-forming capacity of the cells. RNAseq and related bioinformatics analyses showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly involved in angiogenesis-related pathways. The results of qPCR and western blot showed that the protein and mRNA levels of angiogenesis-related factors (VEGF, PDGF, and ANGPT1), as well as vascular endothelial surface marker molecules (VEGFR2, CD31, and c-Kit), were down-regulated accordingly. Furthermore, ChIP experiments showed that UHRF1 was able to bind the promoters of VEGFR2 and CD31, affecting the levels of histone-methylated protein (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) enriched in the promoter region. However, the expression of CD31 and VEGFR2 can be reversed separately after the transformation of different histone-methylated protein levels (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3). Taken together, UHRF1 may regulate angiogenic gene expression and vascular endothelial cell differentiation through epigenetic mechanisms and is essential for angiogenesis.",

The emergence of enzalutamide (Enz), a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor, has effectively extended the median survival of these patients. However, drug resistance frequently develops during clinical use. Multiple studies have suggested that ferroptosis inducers can reverse cancer resistance to Enz, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that CRPC cells exhibit a concentration-dependent decrease in ferroptosis in response to Enz. This change is attributed to the upregulation of the protein level of SLC7A11. Protein stability assays and database analyses showed that SLC7A11 undergoes post-translational modification, likely connected to Enz-mediated downregulation of the SLC7A11-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L. This phenomenon was significantly reversed by the addition of erastin, a targeted inhibitor of the cystine/glutamate transport system Xc-. The data from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that combining Enz with erastin significantly inhibits the proliferation of drug-resistant CRPC cells, thereby enhancing tumor suppression. These findings offer novel insights into targeting SLC7A11 with erastin as a potential strategy to overcome Enz resistance.",

In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of γ- and δ-tocopherol contents in rice using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and post-GWAS analysis. Accordingly, 34,323 SNP markers were obtained from 179 genotypically diverse accessions of O. sativa. Minor tocopherol contents had a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76) with each other and varied greatly across the accessions: 0.015-1.74 and 0.005-0.81 (µg/g) for γ and δ, respectively. A total of 18 QTL on nine rice chromosomes were mapped. Eight transcription factor (TF) genes, five lncRNAs, and two transposons were found to be associated with the QTL. Moreover, three intracellular transport proteins were identified as associated genes with γ-tocopherol on chromosomes 1, 2, and 6. Protein kinases seem to have a substantiative function in defining the minor tocopherol contents, as they were associated with all 18 identified QTL. Haplotype analysis revealed that the QTL, namely qDelt2.1, qGam2.1, and qGam6.1, can maintain significant haplogroups. Comparative transcript analysis between high and low-content minor tocopherols demonstrated the possible involvement of ERF71 (Os06g0194000), TOR (Os05g0235300) and NAC70 (Os02g0822400) in defining the minor tocopherol contents in rice.

Pathogenic missense variants in the same gene may act through different modes of action (i.e., gain/loss-of-function) by affecting different aspects of protein function.

Using the largest-to-date set of missense variants with known modes of action, we show that PreMode reaches state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of mode-of-action predictions by efficient transfer-learning. Additionally, PreMode's prediction of G/LoF variants in a kinase is consistent with inactive-active conformation transition energy changes.

    "combined_text": "Early supplementation for cow's milk allergy prevention in breastfed infants in Poland (ESCAPE-PL): a protocol for randomised controlled trial.\n\nCurrent recommendations for early introduction of cow's milk proteins in infants who cannot be breastfed vary and are inconsistent due to a lack of clear evidence. We aim to assess whether early supplementation with various nutritional interventions, including cow's milk formula (CMF), amino acid formula (AAF), donor human milk (DHM) or high-pressure processed 'pascalised' DHM (DHM-P) is effective for the primary prevention of cow's milk allergy (CMA) in breastfed neonates.\n\nWe will perform an open-label randomised, controlled, head-to-head trial with four parallel arms in three Polish study centres (Warsaw). 1000 healthy full-term newborns of mothers eager to exclusively breastfeed will be allocated to receive early supplementation with one of four nutritional interventions: CMF, AAF, DHM or DHM-P. All children will receive 10 mL of each intervention per day for the first 3 days of life; exclusive breastfeeding will be recommended. However, if any supplementation in addition to the breastfeeding is needed, the assigned nutritional intervention will be provided until 4 months of age. The primary outcome is a cumulative incidence of CMA confirmed by open oral food challenge at 4-6 months and 12 months of age. Secondary outcomes include an incidence of sensitisation to cow's milk protein; a total score in the Cow's Milk Related Symptom Score; the percentage of children with acquired tolerance to cow's milk, feeding difficulties and exclusively and predominantly breastfed; an incidence of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and wheezing; growth; compliance and adverse events. The level of immunomodulatory factors in maternal milk and its nutritional component analysis will also be performed.\n\nThe ethics committee of the Medical University of Warsaw, Poland, approved this protocol (KB/61/2023). The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal no later than 1 year after data collection. The abstract will be presented at relevant national and international conferences.\n\nNCT06652698.",

Clinical data of the child were retrospectively analyzed. Peripheral blood samples were collected from the child and his father and sister. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was carried out. Candidate variant was verified by Sanger sequencing. Genome Browser, AlphaFold, and PolyPhen-2 were employed for protein structure simulation and amino acid sequence conservation analysis. Pathogenicity of the variant was rated based on guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). Literature was retrieved from databases including CNKI, Wanfang, and PubMed using the keyword \"Chitayat syndrome\". The clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with Chitayat syndrome were reviewed and analyzed. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Ethics No.: KY-2024-086-01).\n\nThe child was born at full term and had special facial features, skeletal abnormalities, recurrent respiratory tract infections and global developmental delay. WES and Sanger sequencing revealed that he has harbored a heterozygous c.266A>G p.(Tyr89Cys) variant of the ERF gene. Protein structure modeling suggested that the mutant protein has increased spatial distance between the side chain group and DNA, which may reduce its binding affinity to DNA. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the p.Tyr89 residue is highly conserved across multiple species. The variant was therefore classified as pathogenic (PM1+PM2_Supporting+PM6+PS1+PP3). The patient was diagnosed with \"Chitayat syndrome\". Nutritional support and rehabilitation training were recommended, though the child had died of severe pneumonia at 13 months old. Literature retrieval has collected 7 relevant articles, which involved 14 cases of Chitayat syndrome confirmed by genetic testing. Together with our case, all patients had facial dysmorphisms and skeletal deformities. Fourteen patients (93.3%) had respiratory distress. Seven of them (46.7%) had recurrent respiratory infections and 7 (46.7%) were confirmed with respiratory tract malacia. Eight (53.3%) patients had neuropsychological retardation, while 8 (53.3%) had growth delay. The main interventions for Chitayat syndrome include respiratory and nutritional support, and rehabilitation training for developmental delays.\n\nChitayat syndrome is rarely seen and its clinical manifestations may vary. Airway management and early intervention of developmental delay are important for improving the prognosis.",

A retrospective method was adopted to collect the clinical data of the patients. Whole exome sequencing was carried out to detect GCDH gene variants in individuals with positive results by GA1 newborn screening, and Sanger sequencing was used to verify the candidate variants. Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the pathogenicity of candidate variants was rated. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Hospital (Ethics Number: 2019 Medical Ethics Review No. 67).\n\nEight cases of GA1 were diagnosed among the 814 625 neonates. Blood glutaryl carnitine (C5DC) and urine glutaric acid (GA) levels of the 8 children were higher than the normal reference values. In total 12 variants were detected, all of which were missense variants. c.1064G>A (p.Arg355His) was the most common one, accounting for 21.4% (3/14). Three GCDH gene variants, including 1297G>C (p.Ala433Pro), c.467G>A (p.Gly156Asp) and c.1125T>G (p.Cys375Trp), were previously unreported. REVEL software analysis predicted that all of the three variants were harmful. 3D protein structure modeling indicated that the three variants may cause amino acid residue alterations, and c.1297G>C (p.Ala433Pro) and c.1125T>G (p.Cys375Trp) may result in increase in hydrogen bonds and affect the function of GCDH protein. By December 2023, one of the eight children had deceased, and another child had severe clinical symptoms with poor prognosis. Six children had a good prognosis, of which two had mild motor development delay and four had normal development without clinical symptoms.\n\nThe incidence of GA1 in newborns screened by MS/MS in Henan Province is 1/101 828, and the carrier rate of pathogenic GCDH variants is 1/160. The c.1064G>A (p.Arg355His) may be the hotspot variant of the GCDH gene among children with GA1 in Henan. Discovery of the three novel variants has enriched the mutational spectrum of the GCDH gene and provide a basis for the early diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and genetic counseling of this disease.",

Increased awareness and availability of a novel biomarker for detecting glomerular filtration rate reduction (symmetric dimethylarginine), alongside efforts by the International Renal Interest Society to standardise diagnosis and staging, have led to earlier detection of CKD and an ability to study and trial interventions in sub-populations based on disease severity. As weight loss and phosphorus dyshomeostasis are present in non-azotaemic cats, and progression to azotaemic CKD may occur over time, earlier diagnosis and management represent a compelling opportunity for optimising management of this disease. To date, however, dietary modification (particularly protein- and phosphorus-restriction) in cats with azotaemic CKD is the only intervention demonstrating robust evidence for improving survival times and slowing disease progression. The purpose of this article is to review the available literature supporting criteria currently used to diagnose non-azotaemic CKD and evidence for early intervention, with a focus on dietary modification.",

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate circulating amino acid levels in normal physiology is of critical importance. Evidence indicates that in healthy mammals, post-absorptive circulating levels of essential amino acids are maintained within a range that varies little from day to day or following bidirectional changes in dietary protein intake. This suggests the presence of homeostatic control mechanisms. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for the homeostatic regulation of essential amino acid availability, emphasizing the role of the brain in generating feedback controls to restore baseline levels acutely after a meal and during chronic changes in dietary protein intake. We review current evidence supporting brain amino acid sensing as a component of this regulatory system, integrating peripheral and central signals to modulate dietary protein intake and peripheral amino acid metabolism. We highlight major knowledge gaps regarding the specific neural circuits, molecular mechanisms and physiological outcomes of brain amino acid sensing. Future inquiry using the proposed framework and addressing these gaps will significantly enhance our understanding of the pathways involved in the maintenance of circulating amino acid availability and the regulation of lean mass in health, disease states or in response to therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.",

However, the ecological factors shaping A. baumannii gut colonization remain unclear. We show that A. baumannii and other pathogenic Acinetobacter evolved to utilize the amino acid ornithine, a non-preferred carbon source, to compete with resident microbiota and persist in the gut in mice. A. baumannii encodes ornithine succinyltransferase (AstO) necessary for catabolizing ornithine, especially in conditions of increased microbial diversity. Supplemental dietary ornithine promotes long-term fecal shedding of A. baumannii. By contrast, supplementation of preferred carbon sources-monosodium glutamate or histidine-abolishes the requirement for ornithine catabolism. Additionally, A. baumannii gut carriage is higher in formula-fed human infants, who generally consume higher levels of protein, revealing dietary impacts on Acinetobacter colonization. Together, these results reveal that ornithine catabolism facilitates A. baumannii colonization, providing a reservoir for pathogen spread.",

A crucial catalytic step is conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to phosphatidylethanolamine, driven by direct binding of the E2-like enzyme autophagy-related protein 3 (ATG3) to the ubiquitin-like protein autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12). Disrupting this ATG12-ATG3 protein-protein interaction (PPI) could silence both the degradative and secretory arms of autophagy with high pathway selectivity.

High-resolution crystallography pinpointed a hydrophobic pocket around ATG12 Trp73 that accommodates ATG3 Met157, revealing an \"anchor-and-latch\"-a motif in which one residue ('anchor') buries deeply while flanking residues ('latch') secure the complex- topology ideal for small-molecule competition.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) has attracted more attentions by modulating G protein-coupled receptors and blood pressure. However, it remains unknown whether renal Mas receptor is regulated by GRK4 and its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) exhibited impaired Mas receptor-mediated diuresis and natriuresis, which was accompanied with increased phosphorylation levels of Mas receptors. Similarly, the phosphorylation of renal Mas receptor was increased and its-induced renal effects were decreased in human (h) GRK4γ 142V transgenic mice relative to wild-type littermates. There was a colocalization and a direct interaction of renal Mas receptor and GRK4, which were increased in SHRs and confirmed by rigid protein-protein docking. In vitro studies found that treatment with the Mas receptor agonist AVE0991 inhibited Na+-K+-ATPase activity in WKY renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells, which was failed in SHR cells. GRK4 silencing decreased the phosphorylation of Mas receptor and improved the impaired Mas receptor-mediated inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity in SHR RPT cells. Further study showed that ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction-targeted renal GRK4 depletion decreased Mas receptor phosphorylation and improved its-induced diuresis and natriuresis in SHRs. These suggest that GRK4 contributes to increased renal Mas receptor phosphorylation and dysfunction in hypertension, indicating that targeting GRK4 may be a viable therapeutic approach for hypertension.",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of an eight-week standard (control), high-fat high-fructose (HFFD), alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG)-supplemented (1% in drinking water), and combined diet (HFFD + AKG) on hematological and oxidative stress parameters across tissues of male C57BL/6J mice. Both HFFD and AKG decreased erythrocyte count and altered leukocyte profile, increasing neutrophils and monocytes while decreasing lymphocytes. HFFD increased visceral fat mass and intensified oxidative stress in adipose tissue, as indicated by elevated lipid peroxide (LOOH) levels. LOOH levels in adipose tissue of AKG- and HFFD + AKG-fed mice matched control. HFFD or AKG lowered glutathione peroxidase and NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) activities in adipose tissue relative to control, unlike HFFD + AKG-fed counterparts. The heart showed an adaptive response to HFFD, with increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and NQO1 activities, and lower levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). AKG increased reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and elevated GPx and GST activities in the heart, whereas HFFD + AKG-fed mice had lower LOOH levels than HFFD-fed counterparts. Similarly, HFFD and AKG decreased GSSG and increased GSH in skeletal muscle. Both AKG- and HFFD + AKG-fed mice had lower carbonyl protein levels in muscle compared to control and HFFD-fed mice. Like adipose, muscle of HFFD- and AKG-fed mice had lower NQO1 activity compared to control, unlike HFFD + AKG group. These findings suggest AKG may mitigate HFFD-induced oxidative stress and modulate hematological parameters, with tissue- and diet-dependent effects, suggesting its role as an antioxidant under metabolic stress and a regulator of baseline redox homeostasis.",

To address these challenges, this study developed a streamlined engineering strategy by systematically investigating the osmotic stress response mechanisms of Yarrowia lipolytica CA20 during erythritol fermentation and identifying key genetic determinants of cell growth and erythritol biosynthesis. Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses revealed that nucleotide, lipid, amino acid, cofactor, and vitamin metabolism were essential for osmotic adaptation, which was experimentally validated through targeted gene overexpression. Interestingly, while these modifications improved cell viability, they did not consistently enhance erythritol production. Further, genes A000169 and A004467, coding for a hypothetical protein and a GPR1/FUN34/YaaH family protein, respectively, were shown to be closely associated with erythritol production. Overexpression of A000169 combined with deletion of A004467 and EYD1 generated a robust strain, Yarrowia lipolytica EG01, capable of producing erythritol with a maximum titer of 218.70 g/L and a productivity of 2.27 g/L/h, with an increase of 62.96% relative to the original strain CA20, exceeding previously reported production levels of erythritol in Y. lipolytica using batch fermentation. Finally, two-stage fed-batch fermentation could achieve erythritol titer and yield up to 276.70 g/L and 0.69 g/g within 132 h.

Early prediction of the need for surgical intervention remains challenging due to reliance on late clinical or radiological signs. The C-reactive protein and albumin ratio (CRP/Albumin), reflecting both inflammation and nutritional status, may serve as a dynamic biomarker to guide timely surgical decision-making.  Objective The main objective of this study is to evaluate the prognostic utility of the CRP/Albumin ratio, and its temporal progression over the first three days of illness, in predicting surgical intervention and mortality in neonates. Methods In this prospective cohort study at a tertiary care hospital, Lahore, 66 neonates diagnosed with Bell's Stage I-IIIa NEC were enrolled over a year. CRP and albumin levels were measured daily for three consecutive days, and the CRP/Albumin ratio was calculated. Patients were grouped into progression trends: decreasing, increasing, stable, or variable. Outcomes included surgical intervention and mortality. Statistical analysis included receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and comparative group analysis.  Results Among 66 neonates (mean gestational age: 37.2 ± 3.2 weeks), 42.4% required surgery. Neonates with an increasing CRP/Albumin ratio trend had a significantly higher rate of surgical intervention (89.5%) and mortality (26.3%) compared to those with a decreasing trend (8.1% surgery and 2.6% mortality) (p < 0.001). The CRP/Albumin ratio demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy for surgery, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.926, 0.954, and 0.959 on Days 1-3, respectively. Optimal cut-offs on Days 2 and 3 yielded sensitivities and specificities above 85%. Serial monitoring of the ratio outperformed single-time-point measurements in prognostic value.  Conclusions CRP/Albumin is a simple, reliable, and cost-effective biomarker that can lead to early identification of neonates at risk of surgical intervention and poor outcomes in NEC. Monitoring its temporal progression, rather than relying on single measurements, appears to enhance its predictive accuracy and may support timely decision-making in clinical settings.",

    "combined_text": "Comparison of Zinc Levels in Liver Cirrhosis and Evaluating the Severity Using Child-Pugh Score.\n\nIntroduction Liver cirrhosis represents the final common pathway for chronic liver diseases, characterized by extensive fibrosis and hepatocyte dysfunction. Zinc, an essential micronutrient with critical roles in protein synthesis, enzymatic reactions, and antioxidant defense, has been implicated in liver pathophysiology. This study aimed to evaluate serum zinc levels in patients with liver cirrhosis and correlate them with disease severity as measured by the Child-Pugh classification. Methods This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 85 patients with liver cirrhosis attending the outpatient and inpatient departments of BLDE University's Shri BM Patil Medical College Hospital. Clinical evaluation and biochemical investigations were performed, including serum zinc levels and Child-Pugh scoring. Zinc deficiency is defined as serum levels below 51 μg/dL. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess relationships between variables. Results The study cohort comprised predominantly middle-aged men (95.3%), with alcoholic etiology (n=76, 89.4%) being the leading cause of cirrhosis. Advanced disease was common, with 67.1% of patients categorized as Child-Pugh Class C. Zinc deficiency was observed in 97.6% (n=83) of patients, with mean zinc levels showing a significant progressive decrease from Child-Pugh Class A (50.4±4.31 μg/dL) to Class B (42.32±4.86 μg/dL) to Class C (37.02±3.68 μg/dL) (p<0.001). There was a perfect parallelism between zinc and albumin deficiency (n=83, 97.6%). The mortality rate during the study period was 15.3% (n=13). Conclusion This study reveals a markedly high prevalence of zinc deficiency among patients with liver cirrhosis and establishes a significant inverse correlation between serum zinc levels and disease severity. The observed progressive decline in zinc concentrations with advancing Child-Pugh scores indicates that zinc deficiency may function both as a clinical marker of disease progression and as a contributing factor to hepatic deterioration. These findings highlight the potential value of incorporating routine zinc assessment in the evaluation of cirrhotic patients. Moreover, zinc supplementation may be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy, particularly in those with advanced-stage disease.",

Mass spectrometry analysis identified a specific COP with the sequence Ile-Ile-Ala-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gly-Val-Ala-His. This COP was synthesised to investigate its impact on preventing degranulation. Analysis revealed that COP effectively inhibited the release and production of proinflammatory mediators, including tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, histamine and β-hexosaminidase and influx of extracellular calcium ions. Furthermore, COP significantly suppressed degranulation and inflammatory responses by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor kappa B signalling pathway in allergic mast cells.

A total of 656 apparently healthy women were included according to their clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The determination of AGP1 concentration was performed by nephelometry in serum samples. The results show that the overall mean serum concentration of AGP1 was 76.82 ± 18.63 mg/dL (range 37.95-175 mg/dL).

Previous studies showed that the tight junction protein claudin 1 (CLDN1) is upregulated during tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced inflammation by capsaicin in keratinocytes in a transient receptor potential channel vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-dependent manner. However, the caveat with TRPV1 ligands is the undesired pain response elicited by the activation of neuronal TRPV1 channels. In this study, we hypothesized that also less or non-pungent homovanillic acid esters as structural analogs of capsaicin target CLDN1 upregulation during inflammation.\n\nWe aimed to identify beneficial structural characteristics by selecting homovanillic acid esters with different aliphatic tail structures and screening them for CLDN1 upregulation at early stages of TNFα-induced inflammation in basal keratinocytes.\n\nCLDN1 expression was upregulated independently of TRPV1 by compounds with a tail of 5 or 6 C-atoms, regardless of the presence of ramifications and double bonds with a maximum fold change of 2.05 ± 0.22 against control. The induction of CLDN1 expression was accompanied by increased expression of the differentiation marker involucrin (IVL).\n\nThe results suggest that the homovanillic ester-induced CLDN1 upregulation is a result of increased differentiation of the basal keratinocytes towards the keratinocyte morphology present in the stratum granulosum (SG), where tight junctions are formed. In conclusion, homovanillic acid esters with a 5 or 6 C-atom long aliphatic chain induced CLDN1 expression, thereby stimulating keratinocyte differentiation, independent from TRPV1 activation.",

Additionally, the study showed that E. crassipes had dose-dependent sedative effects, underscoring the plant's potential for targeted sedative uses and the management of stress-induced sleep disturbances. According computational studies, E. crassipes interacts with the COX-1 and COX-2 proteins. Orientin is a promising chemical since it has strong docking scores against both proteins. The possible sedative properties of E. crassipes compounds are further explained by intricate amino acid interactions. The constant B-factor and RMS scores, together with the examination of eigenvalues and covariance matrices, validate the simulations' dependability in confirming the binding stability found in docking experiments.

The aim of this study was thus to investigate the effect of obesogenic diets, obesity itself, and other variables, including mouse vendor, microbiota composition, and sex, on intestinal AMP expression. By using different dietary interventions in mice, we here show that prolonged intake of an obesogenic Western-style diet had a stronger impact on AMP expression than diet-independent obesity. Additionally, when comparing AMP expression under different diets in mice of both sexes from different vendors, the combined contribution of these factors had the strongest impact on absolute AMP transcript numbers, but also on the variability in small intestinal microbiota composition at the mucosa and content.

The results revealed that increasing MLPP levels led to a reduction in moisture content while significantly enhancing protein and ash content (p < 0.05). The pH values increased with higher MLPP concentrations, indicating its alkaline nature. Color analysis demonstrated a decline in brightness (L*) and redness (a*) due to the dark pigment of MLPP, while chroma and hue values exhibited fluctuations over storage. Cooking loss and diameter reduction decreased with MLPP incorporation, suggesting improved fat binding and water retention. Protein oxidation, measured by carbonyl content, was lower in MLPP-containing samples, implying enhanced protein stability. However, lipid oxidation, assessed via TBARS values, increased with higher MLPP levels, likely due to oxidative stress in locust fat. In vitro protein digestibility analysis indicated that MLPP improved digestibility, with the 20% substitution showing the highest values. These findings highlight the potential of MLPP as a functional ingredient in meat products, enhancing protein content and digestibility while influencing physicochemical properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that locust protein powder can be used as a sustainable and nutritious ingredient in meat products, such as emulsified chicken meatballs. Its incorporation improves protein content while maintaining desirable texture and oxidative stability, making it a viable option for the food industry.

While estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remains the gold standard for evaluating renal filtration capacity, its limitations in identifying early metabolic-driven dysfunction necessitate complementary biomarkers. The cardiometabolic index (CMI), reflects metabolic dysregulation but its link to eGFR-defined renal impairment remains unstudied. In this cross-sectional analysis of 13,696 U.S. adults (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2018), eGFR was calculated using the 2021 CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m² indicating reduced renal function). CMI, integrating triglyceride-to- high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Weighted multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates assessed CMI-eGFR associations. Restricted cubic spline and threshold analyses explored nonlinear relationships, while subgroup analyses tested consistency across populations. Higher CMI quintiles showed a dose-dependent increase in reduced eGFR prevalence (Q1: 5.3% vs Q5: 23.8%, P < .001). Fully adjusted models revealed 2.16-fold elevated odds of reduced eGFR in the highest CMI quintile (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27-3.69) versus the lowest. Restricted cubic spline analysis identified a nonlinear threshold effect at CMI = 0.182: below this threshold, each 1-unit CMI increase raised eGFR risk by 86% (95% CI = 1.49-2.23; P = .045), while above it, risk increased by 33% (95% CI = 1.11-1.59; P = .002). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent associations in females, nondiabetics, and older adults (all P < .05), with no significant interactions. Elevated CMI independently predicts reduced renal function, underscoring its utility as a metabolic biomarker for early CKD detection. The identified threshold (CMI ≥ 0.182) highlights a critical inflection point for clinical risk stratification, advocating CMI integration into routine screening to guide preventive strategies against metabolic-driven renal impairment.",

While dietary factors are known to influence bone health, the causal role of specific macronutrients-particularly carbohydrates-remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the causal effect of carbohydrate intake on BMD and to identify plasma metabolites that may mediate this association. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association study summary data from large-scale cohorts. Genetic variants associated with carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake were used as instrumental variables to evaluate their effects on total BMD. To investigate potential mediators, we performed two-step MR mediation analysis to identify plasma metabolites underlying the carbohydrate-BMD relationship. Pleiotropy and heterogeneity were assessed using MR-Egger regression and weighted median approaches. Genetically predicted carbohydrate intake was significantly associated with lower total BMD (odds ratio = 0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.98, P = .021), while no causal effects were observed for fat or protein intake. Mediation analysis identified 3 plasma metabolites-mannose-to-trans-4-hydroxyproline ratio, caffeine-to-theobromine ratio, and mannonate-as significant intermediaries. These metabolites jointly explained up to 27% of the total effect, suggesting that metabolic pathways related to mannose and caffeine may contribute to carbohydrate-induced bone loss.

This study suggests that RSV co-administered with sodium VPA may reduce oxidative stress/inflammation-induced neuronal death by decreasing MDA, HMGB1, and NF-κB levels, potentially offering a synergistic neuroprotective alternative for epileptogenic brain injury treatment.",

    "combined_text": "AgRP neuron activity enhances reward-related consummatory behaviors during energy deficit in mice.\n\nHunger enhances the consumption of rewarding foods, but the neurobiological basis of this adaptation remains unclear. We hypothesize that agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARH) promote the consumption of rewarding stimuli under calorie restriction, independent of caloric content. To test this, we study mice fed 40% of their average daily intake and exposed daily to the non-caloric sweetener saccharin before feeding. We show that calorie-restricted (CR) mice increase saccharin intake before each restricted feeding event and that this response requires ARH integrity. CR mice exhibit activation of AgRP neurons and their brain targets without significant changes in AgRP fiber density. Furthermore, satiated mice increase saccharin intake following chemogenetic activation of AgRP neurons, whereas CR mice with selective chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons show reduced saccharin intake. Thus, we conclude that AgRP neuron activation enhances the consumption of a purely rewarding stimulus in CR mice. These findings contribute to our understanding of how the brain shapes food choices under conditions of energy deficit and could be important for managing food consumption during dieting or in eating disorders.",

Serum uric acid (SUA) is the end product of purine metabolism and is associated with a variety of chronic diseases. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,652 adult women from the 2017-2020 NHANES database to explore the association between AGP levels and gallstone risk and the potential mediating role of SUA. We used multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic spline curves, subgroup analyses, and causal mediation analyses to evaluate the association between serum AGP levels and gallstone risk.Serum AGP levels were significantly associated with gallstone risk. After correcting for covariates, the highest AGP quartile (≥ 0.950 g/L) was associated with a 1.72-fold higher risk of gallstones compared to the lowest quartile (≤ 0.629 g/L) (OR = 2.72,95% CI: 1.31-5.65; p = 0.014). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations in non-Hispanic whites, low-income individuals, and smokers. SUA partially mediated the AGP-gallstone relationship, accounting for 14.76% of the total effect. This study found that AGP levels were significantly associated with gallstone risk in US adult women, and serum uric acid played a mediating role.

The aim of this study is to determine whether the patients with PKU have a normal growth, the incidence of obesity and the relationship of these parameters with diet and nutritional intake.\n\nThis is a retrospective, multicenter, multinational study including patients with PKU from 8 centers from different countries. Data of growth parameters and dietary regimes were collected from birth until the age of 18 years. Anthropometric tools of the WHO (Anthro version 3.2.2 and Anthro plus) were used to calculate z-score for weight-for-age, height-for-age and body mass index (BMI).\n\nData from 182 patients with classical PKU were included. The median height z-scores for both male and female patients showed a normal growth pattern according to the WHO charts. Significant positive correlation  was observed between height z-score and the Phe (mg/day) and natural protein (g/day) intakes in all ages, especially in children younger than 11 years. The amount of Phe-free amino acid mixture did not affect the height, but lower intakes were negative correlated with the BMI. Also, we detected a positive correlation between the median Phe levels and BMI, meaning that the poorer metabolic control was correlated with higher BMI.\n\nAn objective of PKU is that patients have satisfactory final physical development; the height prognosis seems to be associated with Phe and natural protein intake and therefore should be optimized. It is important to collect longitudinal growth data throughout childhood and adolescence in PKU that considers any change in growth in relationship to dietary patterns.",

While dominant phyla such as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes have been extensively studied at the phylum level, the immunomodulatory roles of specific members within these groups particularly the abundant but mechanistically underexplored Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (a member of Firmicutes) and Akkermansia muciniphila (of Verrucomicrobia) remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, current literature primarily focuses on associative findings, and integrated analyses elucidating disease-specific mechanisms and therapeutic relevance are still lacking. In this review, we synthesize mechanistic and disease-specific evidence regarding these two bacterial species across six autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). F. prausnitzii is consistently depleted in autoimmune contexts and exerts protective effects through multiple mechanisms, including short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, Treg induction, secretion of microbial anti-inflammatory molecules (MAM), enhancement of epithelial barrier integrity, and modulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. In contrast, A. muciniphila modulates mucosal immunity via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activation and tight junction enhancement but exhibits more variable patterns depending on disease and host context. This review offers an integrative framework comparing how these two taxa influence shared immune pathways such as the Th17/Treg axis, SCFA-G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) signaling, and epithelial barrier modulation across distinct autoimmune phenotypes. We also discuss therapeutic implications, including their roles as next-generation probiotics and the translational challenges of clinical application. By focusing on two mechanistically distinct but clinically relevant microbes, this review bridges current knowledge gaps and highlights promising directions for precision microbiome interventions in autoimmune diseases.",

Obesity-associated increases in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) have been linked to lipotoxicity. In this study, patients with secondary lymphedema showed a significantly lower plasma polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid (PUFA/SFA) ratio compared to BMI-matched controls. Stearic acid, a common dietary SFA, induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human lymphatic endothelial cells. In a mouse model, a short-term high-SFA diet was used to lower the plasma PUFA/SFA ratio, which worsened tail swelling, oxidative stress, ER stress, and tissue damage following lymphatic injury. Switching to a standard chow diet after surgery prevented these effects. Patients with lymphedema also exhibited elevated levels of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), a lipid chaperone associated with metabolic stress. FABP4 inhibition reduced stearic acid-induced cell death in vitro and mitigated tissue damage in vivo. These findings suggest a pathogenic role for SFAs and support dietary modulation and FABP4 inhibition as potential therapeutic strategies for lymphedema.",

To uncover the influencing molecular signature defining ischaemic cardiomyopathy with diabetes, we performed multi-omic analyses of ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy with and without diabetes against healthy age-matched donors. Tissue was sourced from pre-mortem human left ventricular myocardium. Fatty acid transport and oxidation proteins were most downregulated in ischaemic cardiomyopathy with diabetes relative to donors. However, the downregulation of acylcarnitines, perilipin, and ketone body, amino acid, and glucose metabolising proteins indicated lipid metabolism may not be entirely impaired. Oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, myofibrosis, and cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture also appeared exacerbated principally in ischaemic cardiomyopathy with diabetes. These findings indicate that diabetes confounds the pathological phenotype in heart failure, and the need for a paradigm shift regarding lipid metabolism.",

We here show the expression of OLFM2 to be adipocyte-specific and inversely associated with obesity. OLFM2 levels increase during adipogenesis and are suppressed in inflamed adipocytes. Functionally, OLFM2 deficiency impairs adipocyte differentiation, while its over-production enhances the adipogenic transformation of fat cell progenitors. Loss and gain of function experiments revealed that OLFM2 modulates key metabolic and structural pathways, including PPAR signaling, citrate cycle, fatty acid degradation, axon guidance and focal adhesion in 3T3 cell lines and primary human adipocytes. On the molecular level, OLFM2 deficiency in differentiated adipocytes predominantly downregulates genes involved in cell cycle. Extending these findings in vivo, both whole-body Olfm2 knockout and adipose-specific Olfm2 depletion in mice resulted in impaired adipose cell cycle gene expression, with the latter also displaying fat mass accretion and metabolic dysfunction. Collectively, our results underscore a critical role for OLFM2 in adipocyte biology, and support a causative link between reduced adipose OLFM2 and the pathophysiology of obesity.",

Importantly, nuclear GCK interacts with the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and functions as a protein kinase that phosphorylates TAZ T346. Phosphorylated TAZ recruits peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) for cis-trans isomerization of TAZ, which inhibits the binding of β-TrCP to TAZ and β-TrCP-mediated TAZ degradation. Activated TAZ-TEAD induces the expression of downstream target genes to promote tumour growth.

This paper examines strategies to address inefficiencies in meat production, including high resource use and environmental impacts, by utilising low-value feedstuffs, agricultural by-products, and innovative supplements. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, synthesising recent research from databases such as Scopus and Web of Science, focusing on forage-based diets, grain supplements, marine-derived additives, agrifood by-products, and micronutrient interventions. Findings reveal that forage-based diets enhance health-enhancing fatty acids in ruminant meat, while marine supplements like Asparagopsis seaweed may reduce methane emissions without compromising meat safety. Agricultural by-products, such as grape pomace and olive cake, improve oxidative stability and fatty acid profiles, aligning with circular economy principles. Mineral and vitamin supplementation, including selenium and vitamin E, boosts antioxidative capacity, extending meat shelf life and retail storage quality. However, outcomes depend on feed type, inclusion levels, and animal species, with antinutritional factors requiring careful management to avoid metabolic disorders. The review concludes that integrating diverse feed resources, such as forages, marine additives, and by-products, can enhance sustainability, reduce environmental footprints, and improve meat quality. Strategic implementation of these practices, tailored to regional feed availability and livestock needs, is critical for balancing economic viability, ecological resilience, and nutritional enhancement in future food systems.",

This review explores the structural properties and metal-binding mechanisms of lactoferrin, highlighting its interactions with various metal ions including manganese, silver, zinc, copper, bismuth, vanadium, and lanthanides. These interactions occur through specific coordination at traditional iron-binding sites as well as via nonspecific surface interactions and redox-based mechanisms. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of lactoferrin's structural properties, biological sources and metal-binding mechanisms. The binding of metal ions significantly influences lactoferrin's biochemical activity, affecting its antimicrobial, antiviral, prebiotic, and immunomodulatory properties. The emerging evidence on lactoferrin's interactions with bioactive metal ions indicate its relevance in dairy science, nutrition, and biomedical applications. Understanding these interactions provides new insights into the development of dairy-derived functional foods, pharmaceuticals or sensors.",

Variants that disrupt SLiMs can lead to numerous Mendelian diseases. Although various bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify SLiMs, most suffer from low specificity. In our previous work, we demonstrated that integrating sequence variant information with structural analysis can enhance the prediction of true functional SLiMs while simultaneously generating tolerance matrices that indicate whether each of the 19 possible single amino acid substitutions (SASs) is tolerated. However, the scarcity of representative crystallographic structures of SLiM-receptor complexes posed a significant limitation. In this study, we demonstrate that these interactions can be modeled using AlphaFold2 (AF2) to generate high-quality structures that serve as input for our MotSASi method. These AF2-derived structures show robust performance, both in reproducing known structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and in reflecting the deleterious effects of known sequence variants. This updated version of MotSASi expands the repertoire of high-confidence predicted SLiMs and provides a comprehensive catalog of variants located within SLiMs, along with their respective deleteriousness assessments. When compared to AlphaMissense, MotSASi demonstrates superior performance in predicting variant deleteriousness. By contributing to the accurate identification and interpretation of variants, this work aligns with ACMG/AMP standards and aims to improve diagnostic rates in clinical genomics.",

Its ability to survive in harsh environments and evade antibiotic treatments underscores the urgent need for new therapeutic targets. Emerging evidence suggests that the small protein B (SmpB) may also play broader roles in bacterial virulence, including regulation of biofilm formation, motility, and stress adaptation. However, the specific contributions of SmpB to these pathogenic traits in A. baumannii remain poorly defined. Addressing this knowledge gap is essential for evaluating SmpB as a potential antimicrobial target and developing new strategies to combat multidrug-resistant infections.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing was used to generate a targeted smpB mutant in A. baumannii. The smpB mutant was assessed for growth, biofilm formation, motility, antibiotic susceptibility, and virulence. Biofilm was quantified via crystal violet staining and microscopy, while motility was examined using swimming, swarming, and twitching assays. Antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated using disk diffusion. Virulence was tested in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify changes in protein expression associated with smpB disruption.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing successfully introduced a C212T nucleotide substitution in the smpB gene, resulting in an A89G amino acid change. Growth curve analysis showed no significant difference between the wild-type and smpB mutant strains under nutrient-rich conditions. However, the mutant exhibited a significant reduction in biofilm formation (p = 0.0079) and impaired twitching motility, while swimming and swarming motility remained unaffected. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed increased sensitivity to ceftizoxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin, alongside decreased susceptibility to cefepime, tetracycline, and spectinomycin. In the G. mellonella infection model, the smpB mutant showed reduced virulence, with 84% larval survival compared to 72% in the wild type (p = 0.4183). Proteomic analysis revealed downregulation of key stress response and virulence-associated proteins, including GroEL, DnaK, RecA, and PirA, while proteins involved in ribosome maturation and transcription, such as RimP and RpoA, were upregulated. STRING network analysis supported the broad regulatory role of SmpB in biofilm formation, motility, stress adaptation, and pathogenesis.\n\nThis study demonstrates that SmpB is a key regulator of biofilm formation, twitching motility, antibiotic response, and virulence in A. baumannii. While not essential for growth under optimal conditions, smpB disruption impairs multiple pathogenic traits and alters stress-related proteomic pathways. These findings highlight the potential of SmpB as a novel antimicrobial target, offering a promising strategy to weaken bacterial virulence without promoting resistance. Targeting the trans-translation system may pave the way for innovative therapies against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.",

The role of the extracellular matrix regulator REversion Inducing Cysteine Rich Protein With Kazal Motifs (RECK) in metabolic liver disease is poorly understood. We previously reported that RECK gain-of-function, specifically in hepatocytes, protects against diet-induced MASH. Here, we hypothesized that hepatocyte-specific RECK loss-of-function exacerbates liver injury in a pre-clinical model of diet-induced MASH. Using two novel mouse models of hepatocyte-specific RECK depletion, we demonstrate that RECK gene deletion significantly increased inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis in the liver. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis supported these findings, revealing gene/protein networks associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Targeted assessment revealed that RECK depletion results in elevated hepatic mRNA levels of several genes associated with inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrogenesis. Further, levels of phosphorylated EGFR and its ligand amphiregulin (AREG) were also increased with RECK germline deletion, suggesting a potential link between RECK and EGFR activity. These studies reveal RECK as a critical regulator of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and highlight its potential as a novel therapeutic in MASH.",

Ecolabels could improve the healthfulness of restaurant meal selections and reduce their carbon footprint, but this potential remains largely untested.\n\nTo test whether displaying ecolabels on restaurant menus improves the healthfulness and reduces the carbon footprint of restaurant meal selections.\n\nThis randomized clinical trial was conducted online in September to October 2024. A national sample of US adults (aged ≥18 years) was recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to the ecolabel or control arm. Participants viewed a restaurant menu mimicking a popular full-service restaurant and selected items they wanted to order. Statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle.\n\nIn the ecolabel arm, participants viewed a menu that displayed ecolabels next to entrées and appetizers with a lower carbon footprint (ie, below the median of 1.625 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent [CO2e] emissions per item). In the control arm, participants viewed a menu that did not display ecolabels.\n\nThe outcomes included overall healthfulness (assessed using Ofcom Nutrient Profiling Model scores; range: 0-100, with higher scores indicating healthier items), nutrient content, and total carbon footprint of participants' entrée and appetizer selections and entire orders (including beverages and desserts).\n\nA total of 3147 participants completed the online trial (1560 men [50%]; mean [SD] age, 34.5 [12.5] years). Participants in the ecolabel arm did not select entrées and appetizers (average differential effect [ADE], 0.45 [95% CI, -0.18 to 1.09]; P = .16; Cohen d = 0.05) or entire orders (ADE, 0.47 [95% CI, -0.09 to 1.03]; P = .10; Cohen d = 0.06) that were statistically significantly healthier compared with the selections of participants in the control arm.

The proposed nutritional bioenergetics model is based on the dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory, a mechanistic framework to study individual metabolism. The model is an extension of the typical DEB models in that it includes a digestion module where the protein and non-protein food components contribute to assimilation via the concept of a synthesising unit (SU). The model allows predictions for measurable quantities of interest for aquaculture, including feeding rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide, ammonia and solid waste production, under various temperatures and feeding conditions, both in terms of quantity and macronutrient composition. The feeding schedule's effects, such as the diurnal variation in waste production in response to feeding frequency, are also captured. The model quantifies the effects of the dietary protein-to-energy ratio on food intake and assimilation; energy-rich diets or those with excessive or poor amounts of protein show reduced intake.

The C-Reactive Protein to Albumin Ratio (CAR), an emerging biomarker reflecting systemic inflammation and nutritional status, has demonstrated prognostic value in various diseases. However, its utility in predicting clinical outcomes in RA patients remains underexplored, warranting further investigation to assess its potential role in disease management and prognosis. This cross-sectional study investigates the potential relationship between CAR and RA in United States adults, develops a clinical prediction model, and validates its effectiveness.\n\nTo investigate the association between the CAR and RA using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\n\nThis large-scale, cross-sectional study analyzed data from the NHANES database between 1999 and 2018 (excluding 2011-2014). The CAR was calculated as the ratio of C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin (ALB) levels. RA status was identified through self-reported questionnaire data. Weighted multivariate regression models and subgroup analyses were used to examine the association between CAR and RA. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to evaluate potential non-linear relationships, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were utilized for variable selection in the prediction model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were applied to assess the predictive performance of the models.\n\nThis study included a total of 20,733 patients, among whom 1,744 individuals (4.95%) were diagnosed with RA. After controlling for all covariates, the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated a statistically significant correlation between higher Ln(CAR) levels and the increased incidence of RA (OR:1.77 (95% CI, 1.39-2.25);\n\nThese findings suggest that CAR may serve as a promising inflammatory biomarker for predicting the presence of RA. In the RA prediction model incorporating CAR, we validated the effectiveness and clinical utility of this model, providing evidence that CAR can serve as a biomarker for RA risk prediction.

Treatments applied between 24 and 72 h led to notable improvements in protein content, with germinated-fermented bran flour at 72 h reaching 21.20% compared to 12.62% untreated whole grain flour. Fat and ash contents also increased with treated samples, whereas carbohydrate content decreased with extended processing. Functional properties showed significant shifts, with water absorption capacity increasing in the germinated-fermented whole flour for 72 h (3.73 g/g), suggesting improved hydration behavior, whereas oil absorption increased to 1.43 g/g in the same sample, useful for flavor retention in formulated foods. Swelling power and solubility index also increased, particularly in the germinated-fermented bran flour for 72 h, supporting potential use in soups and instant meals. Foaming capacity improved in several treated flours, peaking at 23.5%, which may benefit baked or whipped products. Dispersibility values above 60% in certain samples indicate reconstitution potential for powdered applications. Acidification during fermentation lowered pH and increased titratable acidity, supporting shelf stability. Color parameters shifted toward darker, less red hues, influenced by treatment type and duration. Antinutrient levels, including tannins and oxalates, reduced significantly, enhancing nutritional quality. Sensory scores favored germinated-fermented dehulled grain at 48 h and germinated-fermented rootless flour for 72 h. Overall, germination and fermentation improved the functionality and nutrient density of pigeon pea flour, supporting its integration into high-protein, ready-to-use food products.",

This study aimed to develop optimized composite porridge flours for pregnant women by blending germinated haricot beans, teff, and barley, using regression modeling and contour plot analysis. The flours were blended within 30%-60% for barley, 10%-30% for teff, and 30%-60% for germinated haricot beans.

However, understanding of how plants counteract fungal sRNAs-mediated trans-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) in plant immunity remains limited. In previous study, a milRNA (Vm-milR1) from Valsa mali can be found to transboundary inhibit the expression of disease-resistance genes MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2 in apple. In this study, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase MdRLKT21 is isolated and characterized, and is confirmed to play a negative regulatory role in the basal immune response. Importantly, MdRLKT21 could hijack Vm-milR1 to rescue the suppression of MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2, and a similar phenomenon is also observed in the interaction between V. mali and pear trees. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that MdRLKT21 can interact with and phosphorylate a C3HC4-type RING finger protein MdRFP1, which positively regulates the apple resistance to V. mali infection. What's more, it is found that MdRLKT21 could inhibit the MdRFP1-mediated immune response, probably by promoting the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of MdRFP1 in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Taken together, it is proposed that an apple susceptibility-related LRR-RLK competitively binds to fungal sRNA effector and subsequently activates defenses by salvaging the expression of MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2 and thereby releasing the resistance protein MdRFP1.",

Since the emergence of the original Wuhan strain, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into multiple variants-including Alpha, Delta, and Omicron-primarily through mutations in the Spike glycoprotein. The S1 subunit, which binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, mutates frequently and plays a key role in infectivity and immune escape, while the more conserved S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion. Anticipating future mutations is essential for guiding vaccine design and therapeutic strategies. Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in protein sequence modeling due to their capacity to produce realistic and functional synthetic sequences. Here, we introduce SARITA, a GPT-3-based LLM with up to 1.2 billion parameters, fine-tuned via continual learning on the protein model RITA trained on 107 017 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 Spike sequences (up to March 1st 2021) to generate high-quality synthetic SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunits.\n\nSARITA is able to generate realistic, full-length synthetic S1 subunits starting from a 14-amino-acid prompt. When evaluated on unseen sequences collected between March 2021 and November 2023-including major Variants of Concern (VOCs) such as Delta and Omicron, and Variants of Interest such as Iota-SARITA outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art LLMs in terms of sequence quality, biological plausibility, and similarity to real-world viral evolution. SARITA generates high-quality sequences in over 97% of cases, with markedly lower False Mutation Rate and higher similarity scores (PAM30, Levenshtein distance) compared to alternative approaches. It also accurately reproduces key mutations characteristic of future variants-such as L212I, R158L, T95P, and E406K-which were not present in the training data but emerged later in VOCs like Omicron and Delta. Structure-based analysis confirms the functional plausibility of these substitutions, with ΔΔG values within experimentally supported thresholds for ACE2 and antibody binding. Furthermore, SARITA anticipates immune-evasive mutations and accurately captures the positional and statistical distribution of mutations found in post- March 1st 2021 variants, highlighting its potential as a predictive tool for viral evolution.\n\nThese results indicate the potential of SARITA to predict future SARS-CoV-2 S1 evolution, potentially aiding in the development of adaptable vaccines and treatments.",

However, the specific role of LQ in alleviating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its correlated metabolic disorders remains to be further explored. This study aimed to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of LQ in modulating metabolic inflammation (meta-inflammation) and mainly focused on a systemic muscle-liver crosstalk mediated by myonectin. High-fat diet (HFD) male C57BL/6J mice were established to evaluate the effects of LQ on hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and secretion of myonectin. The effects of LQ and myonectin on meta-inflammation and the potential molecular mechanisms in vitro were assessed in C2C12 cells and HepG2 cells. In vivo findings indicated that LQ attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and meta-inflammation. LQ treatment downregulated the meta-inflammation-related protein expression levels of CD36 and TLR4, subsequently reducing the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), c-jun, and NF-κB. Administration of LQ was associated with reduced levels of myonectin. Myonectin and PA exhibited synergistic effects on enhancing protein expressions of the CD36/TLR4 pathway, whereas LQ attenuated the activation of these protein expressions. Additionally, a pretreatment with LPS eliminated the protective effects of LQ and restored the effects of PA and myonectin. The mechanisms of LQ on reducing meta-inflammation might be mediated by muscle-liver crosstalk signaling of myonectin, and the CD36/TLR4 signaling pathway was essential in modulating meta-inflammation by LQ. These findings demonstrated the role and mechanisms of LQ in alleviating meta-inflammation, which was mediated through muscle-liver crosstalk signals of myonectin and its downstream CD36/TLR4 pathway. The results would provide novel insights into the potential of LQ as a phytotherapy for NAFLD.",

The effects of pH-shifting, fibrillation treatment (SPF), and mild heating on the physicochemical characteristics, protein conformation, and gel properties of soy isolate protein (SPI) were studied. The result showed that pH-shifting induced a reduction of the smallest particle size from 323.18 to 156.21 nm and the largest total sulfhydryl from 78.56 to 98.45 µmol/g. Compared to the control, the viscosity increased and surface hydrophobicity decreased after modification treatments. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy suggested that the three modification methods significantly changed the secondary and tertiary structure of SPI. In addition, it was found that pH-shifting induced the gel to form a denser gel network structure with favorable gel strength (27.09 g), water holding capacity (98.65%), and thermostability, while SPF induced the gel network to form a loose structure. Thus, modification techniques, particularly pH-shifting, can be effectively employed to enhance the gel properties of SPI. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SPI is highly favored in the food industry due to its nutritional value and sustainability. However, its solubility is low due to its compact structure, which limits its application in the food industry. Modifying proteins with different methods to improve their functional properties holds great significance for the development of plant-based gel foods. This provides valuable insights into optimizing the performance of SPI gel products and promoting the growth of the sustainable plant-based food sector.",

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been identified as a key target in sepsis experimental research. CGRP, a 37 amino acid neuropeptide found throughout the body, plays a beneficial role in sepsis by reducing inflammatory cytokine release, inhibiting the oxidative stress pathway, and decreasing organ-specific inflammation. Research evidence on knockout mice states that specific receptor deficient mice [CGRP receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)] exhibited more pronounced neutrophil aggregation and inflammation compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that a CGRP agonism could be a promising treatment for sepsis. Further, CGRP modulates many specific signaling pathways to protect against sepsis-induced multiple organ damage. The present review includes key aspects of CGRP and in-vitro and in-vivo evidence regarding the prevailing contribution of CGRP neuropeptide in ameliorating sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. This study emphasizes the mechanistic insights into the beneficial effects of CGRP on sepsis-associated organ damage. This current review is the first to compile the effects of CGRP in improving sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for organ-specific damage caused by sepsis.",

    "combined_text": "Microcystin-LR facilitates pubertal bone retardation by interfering with glutamine metabolism to accelerate stem cell senescence through Hippo/GLS pathway.\n\nMicrocystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) is a natural toxin produced by freshwater cyanobacteria that can cause pubertal growth retardation. As bone tissues are the supporting organ of the body, it remains unknown whether MC-LR interferes with adolescent growth and development by targeting bone tissue. In the present study, MC-LR accumulated in bones and caused increased loss of trabecular bone and incomplete bone microstructure, leading to bone retardation in adolescent mice. Moreover, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the bone marrow cavity of MC-LR-treated femurs led to the presence of massive numbers of senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which was responsible for enhanced adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs rather than osteogenic differentiation. MC-LR-treated BMSCs presented an obvious decrease in the expression of glutaminase (GLS), a key gene for glutamine metabolism, accompanied by a decrease in glutamate content and GSH synthesis, which was the main cause of ROS accumulation. Activation of GLS reversed MC-LR-induced BMSCs senescence by promoting glutamine metabolism and reducing ROS release. Moreover, transcriptome sequencing data from BMSCs exposed to MC-LR indicated that the Hippo pathway was enriched, and endogenous levels of Yes-associated protein (YAP) were markedly decreased under MC-LR exposure. The overexpression of YAP promoted GLS transcription by facilitating its promoter, which then reversed MC-LR-induced disturbance of glutamine metabolism and BMSCs senescence. After MC-LR exposure, decreased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity can activate the Hippo pathway. These findings suggest that MC-LR binds to and inhibits PP2A activity, causes activation of the Hippo pathway, blocks GLS-mediated glutamine metabolism, and accelerates BMSCs senescence, which is the key to delaying MC-LR-induced adolescent bone development retardation.",

Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 carrying Angptl7 shRNA under cardiac troponin T promoter substantially reversed Tsc2 deletion-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, the study demonstrated that cardiomyocyte-released Angptl7 activated β-Catenin in fibroblasts and promoted cardiac fibrosis through a paracrine mechanism. Furthermore, chronic supplementation with leucine, an essential branched-chain amino acid, led to adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction through Angptl7 activation in diabetic mice.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that Tsc2 deficiency in cardiomyocytes disrupts cardiac homeostasis and contributes to the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy.

We previously revealed that the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsATL32 negatively regulates resistance against blast disease, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we report the function of OsATL32 in rice immune responses mediated by the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat containing receptor (NLR) protein Piz-t. The M. oryzae avirulence effector AvrPiz-t, a cognate of Piz-t, interacts with OsATL32, enhancing the ligase activity of OsATL32 toward its substrates, including the small GTPase OsRac5. OsATL32 targets Piz-t for ubiquitination, leading to the protein degradation of Piz-t through the 26S proteasome pathway and thus disrupts Piz-t-conferred blast resistance. AvrPiz-t competitively interferes the association of OsATL32 with the protein phosphatase OsPTEN, which dephosphorylates OsATL32 to promote its degradation. Moreover, OsATL32 displays higher affinity to AvrPiz-t than to Piz-t, leading to the dissociation of OsATL32 from Piz-t in the presence of AvrPiz-t. These observations revealed that OsATL32 keeps Piz-t in an inactive state through direct interaction and ubiquitination under normal growth conditions, whereas AvrPiz-t stabilizes OsATL32 and facilitates its E3 ligase activity in ubiquitinating the substrates, including the small GTPase OsRac5 for degradation upon infection by M. oryzae strains carrying an AvrPiz-t allele. Furthermore, AvrPiz-t prevents Piz-t from OsATL32-mediated ubiquitination, thus triggering Piz-t-conferred rice immunity. Our findings demonstrate that OsATL32 connects with AvrPiz-t and Piz-t to modulate Piz-t-conferred rice immunity.",

Even when raised under controlled conditions, poultry are exposed to diverse stressors, such as the hatching process, transportation from hatcheries to farms, vaccination, presence of mycotoxins in feedstuffs, and transportation to slaughter houses, which can have unfavorable impacts on their immunity, productivity, reproductive performance, meat, egg yield, and quality. Curcumin (Cur) is a polyphenolic bioactive molecule found in turmeric, which is used as a natural feed additive in poultry production. The antioxidant characteristics of Cur are due to its chemical structure. Cur can improve the meat quality, such as the color and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents, as well as reducing the drip loss and malondialdehyde concentration in meat. Cur can enhance egg quality characteristics, such as the eggshell strength, yolk color, Haugh unit score, yolk contents of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and yolk Cur concentration. Serotonin secretion is stimulated by Cur, and it prevents heat shock protein 70 and corticosterone production in stressed poultry. Thus, Cur can boost immunity and the effectiveness of vaccinations, and decrease the likelihood of diseases. Therefore, Cur could be applied as an important feed additive and a suitable choice for poultry producers, but it is necessary to know how to select the most appropriate form and level of supplementation before adding Cur to the diets of poultry. The present review clearly describes the impacts of different Cur forms and concentrations of the active substance on poultry production, as well as considering its mode(s) of action. Clarifying the mode(s) of action for Cur could help to identify new uses for Cur that will require examination.",

Therapeutic incretin receptor agonists (RAs), such as tirzepatide, are widely used to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, incretin RAs are facing production challenges at present. Therefore, we engineered transgenic (tg) mice to secrete incretin RAs in milk, leveraging mammary gland bioreactors for cost-effective peptide production. The goat beta-casein promoter-driven constructs encoding tirzepatide-derived peptide linked to human IgG4 Fc via a (GGGGS)₃ spacer were used to produce tg mice. Founders tg-1 and tg-5 exhibited mammary-specific expression, yielding 0.8-1.42 g/l recombinant protein exclusively in milk. Progeny nursed by founders showed sustained hypoglycemia (10-39% reduction; p < 0.05) and marked weight loss (14-49%; p < 0.01) compared to wild-type controls, validating the bioactivity of milk-derived GLP-1/GIP RAs. Moreover, tg-5-nursed offspring experienced high mortality post-Day 16, likely due to overdosing. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the mammary gland bioreactor as a viable platform for incretin RAs production, circumventing complex synthesis and enabling scalable biologics manufacturing.",

Kopyor displays notable phenotypic diversity in terms of cultivar and endosperm quantity (EQ), which refers to the amount of flesh detached from the endocarp. Despite its distinct traits, kopyor utilization is limited because of the lack of comprehensive research on its diverse phenotypes. The aim of this study was to investigate the variations of metabolites and nutrients in kopyors by analyzing metabolomic profiles, physicochemical properties, and proximate characteristics across three cultivars with EQ levels ranging from 10 % to 50 %. The results showed that EQ influenced metabolite accumulation more significantly than the cultivar did. Elevated levels of EQ have been associated with increased concentrations of essential amino acids, which are classified as sensory-related metabolites. An increase in EQ was accompanied by the breakdown of macromolecules, particularly carbohydrates and proteins into simpler sugars and amino acids. This process potentially enhanced the bioavailability of nutrients in kopyor coconuts compared to that in normal coconuts. This study proposed potential metabolite marker for assessing the quality of kopyor coconuts. Valine, an essential amino acid, was the only compound consistently and significantly detected across all analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA), F-test, Tukey's test, Pearson correlation, and orthogonal projections to latent structures regression (OPLSR), conducted on the water and flesh of kopyor coconuts. Consequently, valine was identified as a promising biomarker candidate. This study is the first to extensively characterize the phenotypic diversity of kopyor.

In some of the treated patients, pain resolves with time; in others, it persists, with the underlying mechanisms poorly understood. One prerequisite for neural toxicity is the ability of a drug to penetrate the blood-nerve barrier.\n\nHere, we analysed the pathways involved in early BTZ-induced polyneuropathy development and its resolution in rats and in myeloma patients using pain behaviour, barrier analysis, transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and clinical data.\n\nOne cycle of BTZ elicited transient tactile and cold allodynia in rats.

Derived from legumes, grains, seeds, and nuts, they provide essential amino acids such as leucine, lysine, methionine, and tryptophan. Soy protein offers 36-40 % protein content with a complete amino acid profile, while pea protein exhibits ~80 % digestibility and high arginine levels (~8.7 g/100 g). Substituting animal proteins with plant-based options may reduce LDL cholesterol by 5-10 % and lower type 2 diabetes risk by 18 %. Environmentally, they contribute up to 90 % fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use 75 % less water than red meat proteins. Structural variations in plant proteins influence their solubility, emulsification, and gelation-critical factors in food formulation. Improved emulsifying activity, such as a 25 % increase with heat-modified lupin proteins, enhances texture and stability. Additionally, plant proteins find applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and biodegradable packaging. This review highlights their composition, functional and structural properties, industrial applications, and novel processing technologies like enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to enhance digestibility and bioavailability, positioning plant proteins as vital agents of human health and sustainability.",

We aim to explore possible molecular mechanisms of DBP on Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a combined approach of network toxicology, molecular docking and experimental validations. We retrieved targets of DBP from ChEMBL and STITCH databases, while obtaining AD-related targets from GeneCards and OMIM databases. We identified 193 overlapping targets, and highlighted 13 core targets by protein-protein interaction analysis. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that these targets are mainly enriched in neuroinflammation, synaptic signaling, and metabolic pathways. Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities for AD-related proteins, including translocator protein (TSPO), transcription factor c-Jun (JUN), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). In validation, we exposed DBP (0-200 μM) to N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells for 48 h. Western-blot demonstrated significant upregulation of TSPO, JUN, CDKN1A, and PTGS2, while ESR1 showed an upward trend without statistical significance. In conclusion, DBP may contribute to AD development by affecting AD targets expression (TSPO, JUN, CDKN1A, and PTGS2) and modulating pathways associated with neuroinflammation and synaptic function, providing mechanistic insights on how environmental toxicants may influence neurodegenerative processes.",

Thirty female Holstein calves were enrolled. Newborn calves were fed ∼3.8 L of colostrum within 2 h of birth, followed by 1 to 1.5 L at 11.5 h postnatum. Calves were then assigned to receive either TM (6 L twice daily from dam) or milk replacer (MR; 6 L twice daily, 140 g/L) for 5 d, followed by feeding MR (12 L/d) via an automated system until weaning. Weaning was performed gradually from 8 to 14 wk. From d 14 onward, calves were group-housed in straw-bedded pens (up to 10 per pen) with access to solid feed. Blood samples were collected at different time points: 30 min after birth (before colostrum intake), 12 h after birth following colostrum intake, preweaning (wk 2, 6, and 10 of life), at weaning (wk 14), postweaning (mo 8), at insemination (13 mo), 3 wk before calving, at calving (average age of 26 ± 2.3 mo), and 3 wk after calving. Plasma samples were analyzed for AA, biogenic amines, and AA-related metabolites via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using the Biocrates MxP Quant 500 kit. Volcano plot analysis (P < 0.05, fold change ≥1.5) revealed that 21 plasma metabolites were changed after colostrum intake. Sixteen metabolites increased after colostrum, including essential AA (Met, Lys, Thr, Leu), α-aminoadipic acid, and serotonin, suggesting rapid protein digestion, systemic anabolic activation, and serotonergic stimulation. Five metabolites, including creatinine, Gly, phenylacetylglutamine, and hippuric acid, decreased significantly, suggesting reduced muscle breakdown and early modulation of microbial metabolism. Maturation of kidney function may have increased creatinine excretion. No treatment or treatment × time interaction effects were observed for any of the metabolites, indicating that TM feeding did not alter plasma metabolite profiles. In contrast, significant time effects and principal component analysis confirmed that developmental stage was the primary determinant of temporal variation in plasma metabolite composition. Amino acids, both essential (e.g., Met and Lys, peaking preweaning) and nonessential (e.g., Ala, decreasing near calving), showed temporal shifts reflecting dietary changes and physiological demands. Biogenic amines and AA-related metabolites involved in one-carbon metabolism (betaine and sarcosine, decreasing postweaning and prepartum), polyamine synthesis, and nitrogen catabolism demonstrated coordinated changes. Histidine-related metabolites (carnosine, increasing postweaning) indicated muscle maturation and adaptation to oxidative stress. Tryptophan-derived metabolites (kynurenine, serotonin, and indole metabolites) highlighted immune activation and microbial maturation. Nitrogen metabolism intermediates (citrulline and ornithine, decreasing postweaning; homoarginine, increasing at calving; phenylacetylglutamine, showing transient changes) reflected urea cycle and nitrogen disposal adjustments. Other metabolites, such as γ-aminobutyric acid, taurine, and lactate, displayed patterns indicative of neuroendocrine signaling, antioxidant defense, and energy metabolism shifts throughout development. Overall, plasma AA, biogenic amines, and AA-related metabolites in heifers are primarily influenced by developmental stage rather than TM feeding, with colostrum intake triggering rapid metabolic responses.",

Lactobacillus gasseri KML39 was selected based on its superior casein fermentation properties, proteolytic and antioxidant activities, and probiotic potential, including acid and bile tolerance and intestinal adhesion ability. We found that FSC significantly suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and reduced nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In DSS-induced colitis mice, body weight loss, shortened colon length, and colonic tissue damage were observed compared with the control group. Dextran sulfate sodium also activated NF-κB signaling, leading to the upregulation of iNOS and COX-2 in both colonic and brain tissues, along with elevated serum TNF-α and corticosterone levels. Furthermore, DSS treatment compromised intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity, as indicated by the downregulation of tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin-5). Additionally, DSS negatively regulated neurotransmitter receptors (NMDAR, GABAR, and D2DR) and neurodevelopmental markers (BAX and Bcl-2) in the brain, suggesting neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative effects. The FSC pretreatment effectively restored tight junction integrity, attenuated neuroinflammation, and improved gut microbiota composition. Notably, Proteobacteria and Bacteroides were significantly enriched in the DSS-treated group, whereas their abundance was normalized by FSC pretreatment. These findings highlight systemic inflammation as a key driver of colitis-associated neuroinflammation and demonstrate the potential of FSC as a therapeutic agent for gut-brain-microbiome axis dysfunction in colitis.",

Providing 3-NOP in a partial mixed ration or TMR is recommended to continuously expose the rumen to the additive. During grazing, there is temporarily no exposure to 3-NOP. Therefore, to use 3-NOP as a methane reduction measure in a grazing system, the effect of providing 3-NOP through a mixed ration provided inside the barn only on methane emissions needs further research. Therefore, an incomplete Latin square (balanced crossover) design with 40 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows (average milk yield of 39.8 ± 7.0 kg/d per cow, mean BW 691 ± 63.6 kg, average lactation stage of 122 ± 56 DIM, and a mean parity of 2.6 ± 1.2) was set up including 3 treatment periods and 4 treatments. The treatments consisted of full-time indoor housing with a placebo additive (A), full-time indoor housing with 80 mg 3-NOP/kg DMI (B), 6-h grazing with a placebo additive (C), and 6-h grazing with 80 mg 3-NOP/kg DMI (D). The 24 possible treatment sequences were randomized over the cows in a balanced way based on individual cow information including parity, BW, lactation stage, fat- and protein-corrected milk yield, roughage feed intake, and concentrate intake. The actual 3-NOP concentration in the total diet was 77 mg/kg in treatment B and 80 mg/kg in treatment D. Animal performance, fresh grass intake, methane emissions, and nutritional value of the feed were monitored throughout the experiment. Results showed that DMI was not different between treatments with the same housing conditions, but was significantly lower (-1.4 kg DM/d) for 6-h grazing compared with full-time indoor housing. The milk yield of grazing treatments was significantly lower (-1.6 kg/d) than full-time housed cows receiving the placebo, whereas the milk yield of full-time housed cows receiving 3-NOP was not different from the full-time housed placebo treatment, nor the grazing placebo treatment. However, fat- and protein-corrected milk yield was significantly lower in grazing treatments compared with full-time housed treatments, with -2.57 kg/d for 3-NOP treated cows and -2.03 kg/d for placebo treated cows.

The objectives of this study were to quantify circulating concentrations of proteinogenic AA and branched-chain keto acid (BCKA) and characterize mRNA expression of key enzymes regulating branched-chain AA (BCAA) catabolism. Thirty-six multiparous Holstein cows were enrolled in a randomized block design, receiving continuous abomasal infusion for 21 d after parturition. Treatments (12 cows each) were control (CON), cows abomasally infused with 0.9% saline; cows abomasally infused with BCAA (67 g Val, 50 g Leu, and 34 g Ile; BCA); and cows abomasally infused with BCKA (77 g keto Val, 57 g keto Leu, and 39 g keto Ile; BCK). All cows were randomly assigned to treatments after parturition and received the same diet throughout the experimental period. Blood was collected at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 d postpartum for quantification of 20 AA with liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Liver was also harvested on 7, 14, and 21 d postpartum for quantification of BCAA catabolism genes. Compared with CON, BCA cows had higher plasma BCAA, keto Leu, and keto Ile (but not keto Val), along with higher plasma EAA and total AA (TAA). Abomasal BCKA infusion increased plasma BCKA, Val, and Ile (but not Leu), and elevated plasma EAA without affecting TAA. The BCK cows had higher overall plasma Met and His. Additionally, at specific time points measured, BCA cows had higher concentrations of Lys and Arg compared with CON cows, while BCK cows had higher concentrations of Phe, Met, His, and glutamate compared with CON cows. Compared with CON, BCA cows had greater expression of all BCAA/BCKA catabolism genes for at least one time point measured, whereas BCK cows only exhibited greater expression of Methylcrotonyl-CoA Carboxylase Subunit 1 and Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase on d 14 compared with CON. Overall, these results suggest that postruminal BCAA and BCKA infusion distinctly modulated AA profile and BCAA/BCKA catabolism in fresh cows, revealing divergent metabolic adaptations. These findings highlight the distinct roles of BCAA and BCKA in nutrient utilization and metabolic function during early lactation. Future work is required to evaluate specific changes in the interrelated metabolism of BCAA and BCKA to clarify their specific contributions to lactation performance and metabolic regulation.",

Structural, chemical, and textural analyses of HMMAs manufactured with κ- or ι-carrageenan (0.5 %, 1 %, and 2 %) indicated that ι-carrageenan enhanced fibrous network formation by increasing disulfide bonding, β-sheet formation, and protein interactions, showing greater effects at higher concentrations, whereas κ-carrageenan primarily promoted ionic interactions, minimally affecting texture. These findings elucidate the ability to use sulphate-group variations for protein-structure modulation in HMMAs and underscore the importance of hydrocolloid selection in optimising plant-based meat analogues. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms will aid hydrocolloid selection for plant-based meat formulations, contributing towards fundamental protein-structure research and applied food technology.",

This study aimed to profile concentration patterns including interspecies and regional variations between Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea, and to explore correlations of nutrients and contaminants in five commercially important Arctic marine fish species using supervised machine learning applied to analytical data. These multivariate patterns were subsequently used as input in Monte Carlo simulations to assess the benefit and risk of fish consumption.

It was determined that positively charged amino acids such as histidine, arginine, and lysine, alongside negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acid, as well as the polar amino acid cysteine, can bind to Zn ions in cancer-related ZBPs. Most cancer-related ZBPs are intracellularly localized, found in the nucleoplasm, nuclear vesicles, and nucleoli, and primarily function as transferases or DNA-binding proteins. These cancer-related ZBPs are located on chromosomes 3, 11, and 19. A total of 46 cancer-related ZBPs exhibited interactions with one another, demonstrating complex inter- and intracellular co-regulation of molecular functions and protein-protein interactions. Mutations impact the Zn ion binding sites of many cancer-related ZBPs. Eleven cancer-related ZBPs (TRIM24, WT1, BCL6, MECOM, PATZ1, IKZF3, ZBTB16, ZNF521, BCL11B, TRIM33, and RAF1) were identified as oncogenic, tumor suppressor, and fusion proteins.

This study developed a Pickering emulsion delivery system stabilized by whey protein isolate (WPI) and proanthocyanidins (PC) with different polymerization degrees to encapsulate β-carotene. Compared to WPI, the incorporation of PC significantly increased the UV stability and encapsulation efficiency of BC. In vitro simulated digestion indicated that the WPI-oligomeric PC complex formed a more stable emulsion, reduced lipid hydrolysis, and enabled sustained release of BC. IEC-6 cell experiments demonstrated that the BC-loaded Pickering emulsions had significantly increased cell viability, lowered intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and regulated cellular nitric oxide (NO) production.

However, chickens carry many fatal diseases that compromise their welfare and negatively affect productivity. Among these, coccidiosis, an intestinal disease caused by Eimeria protozoan parasites, affects multiple animal species and represents a major threat to the poultry industry. Eimeria parasites invade the host cell through a distinctive process, depending on gliding motility, and require a transmembrane link between the host cell and parasite cytoskeleton. Each species invades intestinal epithelial cells in a specific gut region, leading to varying tissue damage and morbidity levels. Understanding the preliminary host-parasite interactions is crucial to revealing Eimeria species' conduct and cellular immune responses mediating the primary and secondary coccidian infection, which can inform the development of effective immunological strategies. The interaction between Eimeria invasion proteins and intestinal epithelial cells provokes a moderate immune response marked by elevated IFN-γ and IL-10 production in chickens. In this review, we highlight recent breakthroughs in understanding the Eimeria parasites that affect the host intestinal tract, emphasizing parasite invasion mechanisms, transmission dynamics, host immune responses, coccidian control mechanisms, and the interaction between host microbiota and coccidia. In conclusion, advancing our understanding of Eimeria invasion mechanisms and coccidia control requires a complex approach that combines cutting-edge molecular insights with innovative therapeutic strategies.",

Random forests, convolutional neural networks and other machine learning and deep learning technologies have markedly expedited bioactive peptide discovery, functional characterization and structure-activity relationship elucidation, while their comprehensive application confronts critical challenges encompassing dataset integrity, model architecture optimization, interpretability constraints and experimental verification requirements. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the existing limitations and future opportunities of AI technology in the field of FDPs is required. This review evaluates traditional methodologies and AI applications in FDP research, addressing current limitations and prospects. AI faces several challenges in predicting complex protein structures and FDPs. Dimensionality curse and local optima during protein structure prediction reduce accuracy. In FDP prediction, the selection of amino acid descriptors limits model stability. Additionally, the scarcity of FDP datasets leads to accuracy reduction in AI model training and introduces class distribution bias. Traditional cross-entropy loss further exacerbates class distribution skew. These issues collectively constrain the application of AI in FDP prediction. AI enhances peptide screening efficiency through large-scale data processing, reducing research costs. Standardized multidimensional databases integrated with heterogeneous AI architectures improve predictive model accuracy and cross-domain adaptability. Computational visualization frameworks elucidate bioactive determinants and quantitative structure-activity relationships.

Thus, five groups of 60 tilapia each, in three replicates, were randomly selected from 300 fingerlings of Oreochromis niloticus (15.63 ± 0.05 g, SE). The first group was fed a basic diet and raised in clean water. The remaining fish were grouped into four groups, reared in water polluted with partially lethal trichlorfon concentration (0.38 mg/l), and fed with formulated diets consisting of trichlorfon (control diet), Se-Cys (selenium cysteine), nano-Se (Se nanoparticle), and Se-Met (Se-methionine) added at 1 mg/kg diet each for 90 days, followed by challenge with A. hydrophila. Enhanced growth, improved hematological profile (RBCs, WBCs, Hb, PCV) and minimum serum stress (ALT, AST, glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol) with elevated immunological indices (NBT, lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, albumin, globulin, total protein) were performed by nano-Se supplemented group. Additionally, antioxidant enzyme assays and oxidative stress gene expression (CAT, SOD, GPx, and GST) were effectively augmented by the same group in the sampled tissues. Nano-Se group was noticed by upregulated immune-related selenoproteins (Sepp1a, SelK, GPx2, and SelW) in gill and liver tissues. In contrast, immune stress genes (CASP3, HSP70, TNF-α, and IL-β) were upregulated in the trichlorfon group. Stress hormone biomarkers (cortisol, GH, TSH, T3, T4) and intestinal enzymes (protease, lipase, and amylase) were effectively achieved by the Se-incorporated groups. All Se sources exhibited minimum cumulative mortality compared to the control in response to A. hydrophila. Liver tissues exhibited the maximum Se bioaccumulation and Se concentration factor among all the sampled tissues. This is the first report that we are aware of examining the comparative effects of Se sources on trichlorfon stress in fish models. It could be concluded that supplementation with different forms of Se, mainly nano-Se, successfully ameliorated the toxic effects of trichlorfon in tilapia.",

In a 90-day experiment, the protein-sparing effects of lipids on the growth, nutrient content, amino acid profile, hematobiochemical parameters, digestive enzymes, and antioxidant status of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus were evaluated. Four isoenergetic diets (3223.26 kcal/kg) with varying protein (P) and lipid (L) contents were formulated: D1 (P39/L10, control), D2 (P35/L12), D3 (P31/L15), and D4 (P27/L18). Acclimatized fingerlings (N = 240; initial weight, 12.75 ± 0.2 g) were randomly allocated to four dietary treatment groups (20 fish/aquarium) in triplicate and fed to satiation twice daily. Reducing dietary protein from 39 to 35% with increasing lipids from 10 to 12% maintained optimal growth, indicating a protein-sparing effect. However, further reductions (31-27% protein) in lipids (15-18%) impaired growth and increased biological indices. The body and muscle protein contents remained stable between 39 and 35% protein but declined with increasing reduction, whereas the lipid content increased. Essential amino acids (lysine, methionine, isoleucine), antioxidant status, hepatic enzymes, plasma metabolites (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides), and protease were stable at 39 to 35% protein but decreased beyond that point, whereas the lipase and malondialdehyde contents showed opposite trends. Intestinal morphology (villus height and width, muscle thickness) was unaffected by 39 to 35% protein but was reduced with further protein reduction. These findings highlight the protein-sparing effect of lipids in P. hypophthalmus when lipids increase from 10 to 12% and when proteins decrease from 39 to 35%.",

In this study, the wax contents in germinated sugarcane buds from smut-resistant Zhongzhe 9 (ZZ9) and smut-susceptible Guitang 42 (GT42) were measured, showing that total wax content and alkanol content of GT42 were significantly higher than that of ZZ9 after bud germination. The gene expression profiles of germinated buds from ZZ9 and GT42 were analyzed using transcriptome analysis, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms for cutin, suberine, and wax biosynthesis were enriched between ZZ9 and GT42. In addition, a lipid transfer protein (LTP) gene (c97015.graph_c0) may be involved in wax transportation that caused higher wax content in GT42 buds, and a SoCER4 gene (c120140.graph_c0) may play a key role in alkanol synthesis that caused higher alkanol content in GT42 buds. Here, the SoCER4 gene was functionally characterized via overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The alkanol contents of SoCER4 transgenic N. benthamiana leaves were significantly higher than that of wild type, indicating SoCER4 was responsible for alkanol synthesis.

DUHP pretreatment promoted Ara h 1 glycation, with galactose yielding superior results as the carbonyl donor. Conformational changes in glycated Ara h 1 were observed, manifested by the conversion of α-helices to β-sheets, exposure of aromatic amino acid residues, and reduced surface hydrophobicity. Antioxidant and allergenicity analyses revealed that DUHP combined with glycation was more effective than single glycation in enhancing the antioxidant activity and reducing the allergenicity of Ara h 1. Furthermore, galactose was notably superior to fructose in improving these properties. We hypothesized that the potential mechanisms might include: (1) DUHP pretreatment facilitated the generation of heterocyclic compounds, whose increased levels positively correlated with enhanced antioxidant activity; (2) DUHP pretreatment enhanced the covalent binding of Ara h 1 with reducing sugars, inducing changes in both its spatial and primary structures (glycated sites R334, R348, K413, K547 and K559-all located within IgE linear epitopes). These structural modifications disrupted conformational epitopes and masked linear epitopes, consequently reducing its allergenicity.

Herein a nanomaterial consisting of adipocyte membrane-coated and rosiglitazone-loaded polydopamine nanoparticles embedded in hydrogel (ARNP-H) is designed aiming to induce selective lipolysis in adipocyte through activation of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) by mild photothermal heat stress. Adipocyte membrane-coated and rosiglitazone-loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (ARNP) are taken up by adipocyte to a significantly greater extent than other cell membrane-coated nanoparticles. Adipocyte interactions with ARNP are significantly higher than those with other cells such as macrophages and T cells. ARNP-H enabled selective activation of CMA in adipocytes, increasing levels of heat shock cognate protein 70, a key component of CMA. Colocalization of heat shock cognate protein 70 and breakdown of CMA substrate perilipin 2, led to enhancement of adipose triglyceride lipase access to lipid droplets, initiating lipolysis. In high-fat diet-fed mice, ARNP-H retention at the local injection site is greater than in other groups, maintaining photothermal responsiveness for over 3 days. ARNP-H treatment significantly enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and led to substantial weight loss. While this study focuses on obesity model, ARNP-H for CMA photoactivation holds potential for treating other diseases associated with autophagy dysregulation.",

Mutations in TBX5, a transcription factor (TF) necessary for heart development, are among the causes of congenital heart diseases (CHD). However, further research on biophysical and biochemical mechanisms is needed to understand how missense mutations in TFs alter their function in regulating gene expression. In this work, we applied in vitro and in silico approaches to understand how five missense mutations in the TBX5 T-box DNA-binding domain (I54T, M74V, I101F, R113K, and R237W) impact protein structure, thermal stability, and DNA-binding affinity to known TBX5 cognate binding sites. Differential scanning fluorimetry showed that mutants I54T and M74V had decreased thermal stability, mutants I101F and R113K had increased stability, and R237W had no significant effect on stability. Additionally, DNA-binding affinity decreased for all five missense mutants when evaluated in vitro for known TBX5 genomic binding sites within regulatory elements of Nppa and Camta1 genes. Structural modeling of the TBX5 predicted altered protein conformations and stability due to the loss or gain of amino acid residue interactions. Together, our findings provide biophysical and biochemical mechanisms that can be further explored to establish causality between TBX5 missense mutations and the development of CHDs.",

Its messenger RNA (mRNA) expression peaked in 5-day-old female adults, with highest levels in the head and fat body. RNAi-mediated knockdown of SfAkt significantly suppressed vitellogenin (Vg) expression and impaired ovarian development. Additionally, reducing fecundity and oviposition by over 90%, and decreasing rice damage by more than 60%. Further assessment of SfAkt utility in planta, a total of 27 transgenic rice plants were generated, with six independent transformants found to contain a single copy of the dsSfAkt expression cassette.

The production of Epitheliocystis by Candidatus Syngnamydia salmonis poses several challenges to the aquaculture industry. Currently, limited drugs and therapies are available to effectively manage and cease the spread of this disease. The goal of this study was to develop a potential drug target for the treatment of epitheliocystis. Salicin, an organic glucoside widely known for its anti-inflammatory characteristics, was chosen as the initial compound because of its pharmacological significance and confirmed as a bioisostere (a compound with identical biological activities but a different structure). The Xundrug MolOpt AI generative model of bioisosteric replacement tool was chosen as the optimisation technique in a cognitive exertion to improve the novel drug candidate salicin by its AI-assisted bioisosteric replacement. To retrieve the docking results, the top three ligands from Xundrug and the cell division protein of Candidatus Syngnamydia salmonis were uploaded to the HDOCK web server, which utilises a hybrid docking technique combining template-based modelling for docking. The target drug candidate was selected based on model 17's highest docking score of 135.6 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the Lipinski rule of five and the ADMET properties of the Bioisosteric Replaced Salicin model 17 (BRS-17) were carefully explored. The results showed that BRS-17 fulfilled the pharmacophore characteristics criteria, hence making it an ideal target candidate for Candidatus Syngnamydia salmonis' cell division protein. Additionally, the results are supported by -6.735Kcal/mol docking score predicted by DockThor. With the help of the supporting information from this study, the proposed drug design can close the gap in earlier studies for resistance to antibiotic treatments.

Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the use of a ketogenic diet (KD) delays the onset of AD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether KD has an ameliorative effect on AD through the regulation of melatonin receptors. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham, AD, and KD. At the end of KD supplementation, behavioral parameters were determined by the Morris Water Maze. Melatonin levels, protein expression levels, and immunoreactivity of MT1-MT2 in thehippocampus and striatum were determined by ELISA, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. As a result, KD improved memory decline in AD rats. Also, KD increased melatonin levels in the hippocampus but did not affect striatum melatonin levels. MT1 expression tended to increase in the hippocampus of the AD group, while MT2 expression decreased. On the contrary, KD treatment increased both MT1 and MT2 expressions. In the striatum, there was no change in MT1 expression in the AD and KD groups, but MT2 expression increased in the AD group compared with the sham group and was suppressed in the KD group. In addition, KD treatment reduced streptozotocin-induced apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and striatum. Our results suggest that KD may improve AD-associated inflammation and apoptosis by altering melatonin levels and the expression of MT2 receptors in the hippocampus and striatum.

    "combined_text": "Advanced Strategies for Managing Pleuroperitoneal Communication in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: Report of Two Cases.\n\nBACKGROUND Pleuroperitoneal communication (PPC) is a rare yet significant complication in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), characterized by an abnormal connection between the peritoneal and pleural cavities. This condition can lead to pleural effusion, respiratory complications, and, in severe cases, necessitate the discontinuation of PD in favor of hemodialysis, threatening residual renal function. While the incidence of PPC is low (1-6%), it presents considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach. CASE REPORT We report 2 cases of PPC managed at our center, highlighting the role of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Both cases were diagnosed via peritoneal scintigraphy using 99mTc-labeled albumin and confirmed with computed tomography (CT). The first case, a female patient, transitioned to extracorporeal dialysis following diagnosis. The second case, a male patient, initially underwent conservative management with a very-low-protein diet for 45 days. Follow-up scintigraphy showed resolution of the leakage. However, approximately 1 month after resuming peritoneal dialysis, he had a recurrence. After implementation of an optimized nutritional protocol and a consultation with a thoracic surgeon, a decision was made to proceed with minimally invasive repair via video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). This approach included defect closure with Prolene® sutures and fibrin glue application. VATS allowed resolution of the complication and postoperative PD resumption with reduced volumes. CONCLUSIONS Our findings emphasize the importance of early diagnosis using advanced imaging, tailored nutritional therapy to bridge treatment, and minimally invasive surgical techniques to preserve PD and renal function. Peritoneal scintigraphy offers high precision in mapping the anatomical defect, facilitating targeted surgical intervention VATS. Combined with preoperative imaging, it proved to be a precise and effective intervention. Dietary intervention successfully prevented the transition to extracorporeal dialysis. A multidisciplinary team involving nephrologists, thoracic surgeons, nuclear medicine specialists, and dietitians was crucial for optimizing outcomes. Future research should focus on standardizing diagnostic protocols and surgical techniques to improve PPC management, reduce recurrence, and enhance patient quality of life.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the intestinal microbiota and bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in slow and fast growing broiler chickens, which belonged to the 10\n\nA total of 300 Ross 308 broiler chickens (100 per cohort from three independent cohorts) were selected and mucosal samples from the jejunum, ileum, and cecum were collected at day of arrival, 11 and 25 (n = 450). Then, bacterial counts, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, species specific real-time qPCR, as well as BSH activity were analyzed.\n\nResults of bacterial counts showed no significant difference between slow and fast growing cohorts (P > 0.05), but they tended to be higher in the slow growing chickens in all measured bacterial groups in cecum. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed higher relative abundance of E. coli-Shigella (71.3%-79.8%) at day of arrival, while the most abundant microorganisms at d 25 was Candidatus Arthromitus (slow: 44.5%; fast: 27.4%) in small intestine. qPCR results indicated significant differences in bacterial populations between the slow and fast growing chickens, especially higher total bacteria, Enterococcus, and Clostridium cluster I in the slow growing chickens at d 25. BSH activity was higher in the slow growing chickens than the fast growing chickens [slow: 0.476 ΔOD/protein (μg/mL); fast: 0.258 ΔOD/protein (μg/mL); P < 0.0001], and correlation analysis highlighted associations between BSH activity, body weight, feed intake, body weight gain, and bacterial counts.\n\nWe postulate that high total bacteria and Enterococcus abundance are associated with high BSH activity, impacting low feed intake and body weight gain, ultimately resulting in separation into slow and fast growing birds. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the relationship between gut microbiota, BSH activity, and host physiology in broiler chickens, with potential implications for poultry production.",

However, research on the synergistic effects of nutritional interventions and resistance training in promoting muscle hypertrophy is characterized by thematic fragmentation, insufficient integration between mechanistic and applied research, and imbalances across different regions and population groups.\n\nTo systematically delineate the developmental trajectory and emerging trends in this field, a comprehensive search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection, initially retrieving 456 publications. After rigorous screening and data cleaning, 411 English-language articles published between 1992 and 2025 were retained for analysis. Scientometric techniques were applied to construct knowledge maps using three major tools: Bibliometrix (R 4.4.3), VOSviewer (1.6.20), and CiteSpace (6.2.6). Bibliometrix was used to analyze publication trends and thematic evolution; VOSviewer to map keyword co-occurrence and collaboration networks; and CiteSpace to detect citation bursts and visualize knowledge structures. Collectively, these methods facilitated the identification of high-frequency keywords, hotspot transitions, collaborative patterns, and underexplored thematic gaps.\n\nThe results indicate that: (1) the combination of protein supplementation and resistance training represents the most prominent intervention strategy; (2) a stable tripartite research model has emerged, centering on the interaction among training, nutrition, and structural adaptation; (3) the thematic focus has gradually shifted from molecular mechanisms toward practical applications, emphasizing issues such as aging and functional improvement; and (4) notable research gaps remain, particularly the underrepresentation of women and Asian populations, insufficient attention to recovery, metabolism, and periodized nutrition, and the lack of a systematic framework for individualized interventions.\n\nThis study delineates the developmental trajectory, structural characteristics, and future directions of research in this field over the past three decades, providing empirical evidence and a theoretical foundation for the scientific formulation of muscle health enhancement strategies.",

The N protein is highly immunogenic and plays a key role in the processes of viral infection and replication, making it of significant research value in both basic studies and clinical applications.\n\nTo further investigate the functions of SARS-CoV-2 N protein, the Matchmaker Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid System was used to identify potential interacting partners of the N protein in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

We further validated the interaction between the N protein and two host proteins, RNF2 and ARL15, which showed the highest positive clone rates at the cellular level. We also predicted the critical amino acid residues mediating the interaction of the N protein with RNF2 or ARL15. Additionally, we explored the impact of these two host proteins on coronavirus replication. Functional analysis of all the 11 host proteins revealed their involvement in ribosome biogenesis, antigen processing and presentation, as well as various signaling pathways such as JAK-STAT.\n\nThis study further enriches the understanding of interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and host, providing important theoretical insights for the deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis and the development of antiviral strategies.",

We also evaluated the changes in expression of inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6) as well as Leucine rich repeat and Immunoglobin-like domain-containing protein 1 (Lingo-1), a prominent gene involved in the pathogenesis of ET.\n\nMale Swiss Webster mice were divided into four groups: control, harmaline (10 mg/kg), ketamine (8 mg/kg), and harmaline + ketamine. Tremor severity, muscle strength, locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and passive avoidance learning were assessed. Cerebellar expression of Lingo-1 and IL-6 was analyzed using real-time PCR.\n\nKetamine did not significantly reduce harmaline-induced tremors but improved muscle strength deficits in the wire grip test. In the open field test, ketamine normalized some harmaline-induced changes in locomotor activity and grooming behavior. No significant differences were observed in passive avoidance learning across groups. At the molecular level, ketamine did not mitigate the harmaline-induced increase in IL-6 expression, and Lingo-1 expression was not significantly altered by either harmaline or ketamine treatment.\n\nOur findings suggest that ketamine has limited efficacy in the harmaline ET model, showing some improvements in motor function and anxiety-like behavior but failing to address core tremor symptoms or modulate inflammatory and Lingo-1 pathways.

Whereas expansins were first discovered in plants, expansin-related proteins have since been identified in bacteria and fungi. The biological function of microbial expansins remains unclear; however, several studies have shown distinct binding preferences toward different structural polysaccharides. Earlier studies of bacterial expansin-related proteins uncovered sequence and structural features that correlate to substrate binding. Herein, 20 fungal expansin-related sequences were recombinantly produced in Komagataella phaffii, and the purified proteins were compared in terms of substrate binding to cellulosic and chitinous substrates. The impact of pH on the zeta potential of prioritized substrates was also measured, and Principal Component Analysis was performed to uncover correlations between protein characteristics (e.g., pI, hydrophobicity, surface charge distribution) and measured substrate binding preferences. Whereas acidic proteins with a predicted pI less than 5.0 preferentially bound to chitin, basic proteins with pI greater than 8.0 preferentially bound to xylan and xylan-containing fiber. Similar to many cellulases, binding to cellulose was correlated to relatively high aromatic amino acid content in the protein sequence and presence of a carbohydrate binding module (CBM), which in the case of expansins is a C-terminal CBM63. Whereas overall sequence characteristics could be correlated to substrate binding preference, the identity of amino acids occupying conserved positions that impact protein activity was better correlated with loosenin versus expansin classifications.",

However, the association between CTI and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or its mortality has rarely been studied. This study sought to examine CTI's associations with CVD mortality, CVD incidence, and all-cause mortality.\n\nThis study included 8,679 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2010, 2015-2018. The CTI was derived as: 0.412* Ln (CRP [mg/L]) + Ln (TG [mg/dl] × FPG [mg/dl])/2, with participants categorized into quartiles.

CTI significantly predicted both CVD mortality (HR 2.28 [1.69-3.24]) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.14 [1.76-2.55]).

Specifically, the association was similar between male and female, and similar in young participants and elderly participants. In different glycemic status, high levels of CTI were found to be linked to an increased risk of CVD in individuals without diabetes mellitus (DM).

Nutritionally regulated adipose and cardiac enriched protein (NRAC) is a small adipocyte-specific transmembrane protein with unknown function. Here, we show that Nrac directly interacts with scavenger receptor CD36 via its first transmembrane domain. Forming a complex with CD36 and caveolin-1 under low extracellular fatty acid (FA) concentrations, NRAC modulates CD36-dependent fatty acid uptake in adipocytes. Upon increase in extracellular FA levels, NRAC is ubiquitinated and internalised, leading to CD36's dissociation from caveolin-1 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This results in increased fatty acid uptake into fat cells, adipocyte hypertrophy, increased fat mass and elevated lipid clearance from the blood in chow-diet-fed mice. Finally, human NRAC expression and the intronic SNP rs12878589 are associated with body fat distribution and obesity. Together, these findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which adipocytes sense and respond to extracellular fatty acid availability to fine-tune lipid uptake and storage at cellular and organismal level.",

During Arabidopsis vernalization, prolonged cold exposure results in the formation of a Polycomb-repressed domain at the potent floral repressor FLC to confer its stable silencing upon temperature rise or epigenetic 'memory of prolonged cold', enabling the plants to bloom in spring. Here we report that the evolutionarily conserved casein kinase CK2 phosphorylates and thus stabilizes histone 3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methyltransferases (PRC2 subunits) to promote H3K27 trimethylation throughout the Arabidopsis genome. We found that prolonged cold induces progressive CK2 accumulation, leading to a gradual accumulation of cellular PRC2. We further show that the cold-CK2-PRC2 signalling promotes increasing PRC2 enrichment on FLC chromatin during prolonged cold exposure as well as post-cold PRC2 spreading across FLC to establish a Polycomb-repressed domain for FLC repression in warmth. Thus, this signalling cascade transduces prolonged cold exposure, but not cold spells, into epigenetic memory of prolonged cold in warmth during vernalization. CK2 phosphorylation motifs are widely present in H3K27 methyltransferases from plants and animals. Our study reveals a new layer of control of PRC2 activity in multicellular organisms.",

    "combined_text": "Multi-target-responsive AIE material for in situ visualization of level 3 features in latent fingerprints.\n\nThe development of level 3 features of latent fingerprints (LFPs), such as the shape of ridges and the size of sweat pores, plays a pivotal role in enhancing the matching of damaged fingerprints. However, most current LFP developers exclusively target lipids and typically require mixed-solvent systems, neglecting critical components like amino acids. This limitation, coupled with the inherent degradation of LFP components over time, hinders the reliable visualization of Level 3 features across diverse fingerprint states. Consequently, the development of hydrophilic, multi-target-responsive AIE materials represents a critical advancement in forensic individual identification.\n\nWe report the design of a cationic amphipathic AIE material with -COOMe groups (AIE-COOMe) that can visualize multiple target secretions to produce PL images of level 3 features using an aqueous solution under visible light. In single-component fluorescence assays, AIE-COOMe demonstrated selective targeting toward amino acids (glycine, D-phenylalanine, l-tryptophan), proteins (lysozyme, keratin), and lipids (cholesterol, oleic acid-triglyceride mixtures), enabling accurate visualization of LFPs despite dynamic variations in their secretion composition. DFT calculations revealed that the -COOMe groups enhance hydrogen-bonding interactions, facilitating selective anchoring to amino acid-containing compounds. Furthermore, hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic forces were identified as key mechanisms driving lipid targeting and subsequent aggregation-induced emission.\n\nThis study employed multiple intermolecular forces (including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions) to enable rapid anchoring of AIE materials to diverse LFPs secretions. This approach effectively addressed the limitation of poor recognition and imaging associated with reliance on a single type of secretion, thereby establishing a foundation for the precise identification of fragmentary LFPs.",

    "combined_text": "To what extent is Anfinsen's Thermodynamic Hypothesis consistent with the formation and polymorphism of amyloid fibrils?\n\nFor half a century, Anfinsen's Thermodynamic Hypothesis has been considered the central pillar of protein science. In Anfinsen's words, this hypothesis holds that \"…the three-dimensional structure of a native protein in its normal physiological milieu…is the one in which the Gibbs free energy of the whole system is lowest; that is, that the native conformation is determined by the totality of interatomic interactions and hence by the amino acid sequence, in a given environment\". Applying this hypothesis to amyloid fibril-forming proteins presents challenges, which we contemplate in four questions. First, what is the \"native\" structure of amyloid-forming proteins, many which are intrinsically disordered or are proteolytic fragments of larger proteins? Second, what is the thermodynamic landscape for the conversion of native monomers to highly stable fibril assemblies? Third, how do we reconcile Anfinsen's hypothesis, that a protein's amino acid sequence determines its 3-dimensional structure, with amyloid fibrils, for which single protein sequences are capable of folding into multiple polymorphs? Fourth, what is the \"physiological milieu\" of amyloid fibrils? Is it increased local concentration, cofactor binding, post-translational modifications, or cellular programming of diseased tissues? We discuss answers supplied by ex vivo observations and in vitro experiments, and conclude that amyloid protein structure in vivo is determined by its sequence and its physiological milieu.",

In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of Heliocidin, a novel AMP purified from the visceral tissue of the sea urchin Heliocidaris crassispina. Heliocidin was purified using a series of HPLC steps, and its molecular mass was determined by LC-MS. Edman degradation identified the N-terminal 17 amino acid residues, and cDNA cloning revealed the full nucleotide sequence of 838 bp encoding a precursor protein of 107 amino acids. This precursor protein comprised a signal peptide with 30 AAs and a mature peptide with 17 AAs. Heliocidin shared no significant sequence homology with other known peptides. The C-terminal amidation of Heliocidin was confirmed through HPLC retention time analysis, which was further supported by the cloning results showing a glycine residue juxtaposed to Heliocidin's C-terminus. Synthetic Heliocidin with amidated C-terminus showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and a fungus. This antimicrobial activity is attributed to the presence of C-terminal amidation, as the OH-type Heliocidin exhibited no detectable antimicrobial effect. Moreover, Heliocidin's antimicrobial mode of action is likely through interactions with the bacterial outer membrane consistent with inner and outer membrane permeability assay results. Transcriptional expression analysis demonstrated that Heliocidin's mRNA was predominantly expressed in coelomocytes, immune cells crucial to the sea urchin's defense system. Heliocidin transcript was upregulated following immune challenge, indicating its role in the innate immune response of H. crassispina. This study represents the first report of an antimicrobial peptide in H. crassispina, expanding our understanding of echinoderm immune defense and providing a foundation for the discovery of novel AMPs in marine invertebrates.",

Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 7 (TAF7), a core component of the TFIID complex, is known to regulate transcription through interactions with other transcription factors. However, its role in crustacean immunity remains largely unexplored. In this study, we cloned and functionally characterized a TAF7 homolog from P. vannamei, designated as PvTAF7. The gene comprises an open reading frame (ORF) of 1110 bp, encoding a 369-amino-acid protein containing a conserved TAFⅡ55 domain. Phylogenetic analysis clustered PvTAF7 within the Decapoda clade, indicating strong evolutionary conservation among crustaceans. Tissue distribution analysis showed that PvTAF7 is highly expressed in the hepatopancreas and hemocytes, key immune tissues in shrimp. PvTAF7 expression was significantly upregulated in response to Vibrio parahaemolyticus (including the AHPND strain) in both hemocytes and hepatopancreas. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of PvTAF7 led to reduced expression of immune-related genes, including lysozyme, crustins, hemocyanins, and the transcription factor PvYY1, and resulted in increased mortality following Vibrio infection. Moreover, GST pull-down assays and structural modeling demonstrated that PvTAF7 interacts with PvYY1 via its TAFⅡ55 domain and the zinc finger domain of PvYY1, forming a functional protein complex. Collectively, these findings reveal that PvTAF7 plays a critical role in the antibacterial immune response of P. vannamei, likely by regulating immune gene expression through its interaction with PvYY1.",

To date, there is no evidence regarding targeted nutrition and hydration interventions initiated directly in the ED setting. The primary aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of such an intervention, defined in terms of eligibility, recruitment rate, retention, representativeness, compliance to and effect of the intervention, and completeness of outcome data collection. This information will help establish the parameters required to design an eventual future definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nThe study was a feasibility study conducted at the ED and in cooperation with four municipalities. Older patients at nutritional risk (defined by a nutritional risk score of minimum 3 according to NRS 2002) and/or dehydrated (p-osmolarity >295 mmol/L) were provided with individual dietary counselling initiated in the emergency department and followed-up by a dietitian or other health care professionals in the municipalities. Data were collected on eligibility, recruitment, and retention of the older participants and completeness of data collection. Compliance was assessed as change in intake of energy, protein and fluids, self-efficacy, quality of life, prevalence of readmissions, and mortality within 30 days.\n\nOf those 326 screened for the study, 314 (96%) were eligible due to either dehydration or nutritional risk. It was possible to recruit more than half (58%) of those invited to participate and the retention rate was high (90%). Completeness of data collection was above 80% for most of those assessed. There was an increase in intake of energy (p=0.0012), protein (p=0.0002), and fluid (p=0.0040), quality of life (p=0.0007), and self-efficacy (p=0.0498). The prevalence of readmissions was 19%, and 7% had died.\n\nThe detection, treatment and follow-up of nutritional risk and dehydration in vulnerable older patients in the ED was proven to be feasible in relation to eligibility, recruitment, and retention. Further, most of the chosen outcomes had a high rate of completeness and hence may be relevant parameters to include in an eventual future RCT. The explorative nature of the study limits firm conclusions; however, the positive findings support the initiation of a definitive RCT.",

For all samples, the droplet size first significantly declined and then increased when the sanxan concentration was raised from 0 to 0.75 %. Under optimized conditions (0.5 % sanxan, two-step method), emulsion gels with small droplet sizes (3.42 μm) and good storage stability could be produced. The freeze-thaw stability of PNP/HRGF emulsion gels was significantly enhanced after the incorporation of sanxan, as seen by a lower free water content determined by NMR relaxation studies. Small and large amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS and LAOS) analysis showed that all the samples were predominantly elastic-like materials that exhibited strong shear thinning behavior. During simulated small intestinal digestion, PNP/HRGF emulsion gels containing 0.5 % sanxan had a significant lower final free fatty acid release when they were prepared using two-step method (69 %) than the one-step method (80 %), or when that did not contain sanxan (91 %).

In this study, characterize a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase and identify a novel protein, PdeB, which contains both GGDEF and EAL domains and regulates motility and biofilm formation. PdeB enhances swarming by regulating lateral flagella expression. Intriguingly, although PdeB operates as a phosphodiesterase, its activity depends not only on the EAL domain but also requires the synergistic action of both the GGDEF and EAL domains. Furthermore, specific amino acid residues within the GGDEF domain are critical for PdeB's enzymatic function. Under conditions of elevated c-di-GMP resulting from scrABC knockout, PdeB is crucial in controlling swarming motility. It suppresses the transcription of vpa1446 and vpa1403, which are involved in the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, thus inhibiting biofilm biosynthesis. Additionally, transcriptomic sequencing further reveals that PdeB significantly influences physiological processes, with notable differential expression of flagellar-related and biofilm regulatory genes under liquid versus surface conditions. Additionally, PdeB gene expression is modulated through quorum sensing.

Nuclear receptor Nur77 has been implicated in multiple programmed cell death pathways.

Nur77 deficiency in Paneth cells altered ileal microbiota rather than intestinal stem cell niche after LPS challenge. Nur77 deficiency-induced Paneth cell necroptosis was attributed to impaired ER homeostasis caused by defective ER-phagy. Mechanistically, LPS induced Nur77-PKCα interaction and their subsequent translocation to the ER, which promoted AMFR phosphorylation, FAM134B ubiquitination and subsequently ER-phagy.

    "combined_text": "Unlocking the potential of whey protein isolate: How ultrasonic treatment transforms functionality and structure.\n\nThis study explores the transformative effects of ultrasonic treatment on the physicochemical, structural, and functional properties of whey protein isolate (WPI). WPI solutions were subjected to ultrasonic treatment at two power levels (300 W and 600 W) for durations of 10 and 20 min. The findings reveal a fascinating interplay between ultrasonic parameters and protein behavior: at 300 W, the treatment induces protein unfolding, while at 600 W, it promotes the formation of large aggregates. These changes are accompanied by significant alterations in secondary structures, with a reduction in β-sheet and α-helix content at 300 W, followed by their re-enhancement at 600 W. Notably, ultrasonication at 600 W significantly enhances di-tyrosine formation, sulfhydryl content, and surface hydrophobicity, compared to untreated samples. Zeta-potential measurements demonstrate a decrease after 10 min of treatment at both power levels, but an increase is observed after 20 min, indicating dynamic shifts in surface charge. Additionally, ultrasonic treatment elevates interfacial tension. WHC increases by 2.2-fold and 3.2-fold after 20 min of treatment at 300 and 600 W, respectively. At 600 W, a marked reduction in solubility and a substantial increase in turbidity are observed, contrasting with the outcomes at 300 W. Despite this, the highest emulsification activity and stability are achieved with WPI treated at 600 W for 20 min, underscoring the potential of ultrasonication to optimize emulsion-based applications. These findings emphasize the critical role of precise control over ultrasonic power and treatment duration to achieve desired functional outcomes.",

Wheat silage is widely cultivated across many regions, making it a practical and cost-effective alternative to alfalfa hay, particularly in areas where alfalfa is expensive or scarce. Sixty-four male small-tailed Chinese Han lambs with similar BWs (15.6 ± 0.41 kg) were selected and divided into four treatment diets according to the proportion of wheat silage replacing alfalfa hay:WS0 (WS: AH = 0: 100), WS36 (WS: AH = 36: 64), WS64 (WS: AH = 64: 36), and WS100 (WS: AH = 100: 0). Forage to concentrate ratios were fixed at (25:75) during Stage 1 (lambs aged 2-4 months) and (20:80) during Stage 2 (lambs aged 4-6 months). Results demonstrated that the digestibilities of ADF and NDF were greater (P < 0.01) in both WS36 and WS64 than in the WS100 group during Stage 1, and no significant differences were observed between the WS0 and WS100 groups. However, during Stage 2, the digestibility of both ADF and NDF was significantly lower in the WS100 group compared to the other three treatments. In terms of growth performance, the WS36 group had the greatest final BW in both stages. Ruminal pH and the molar propionate percentage decreased linearly with the increase of WS inclusion, while the molar acetate percentage and acetate: propionate ratio increased linearly with the increase of WS inclusion in both stages. However, the concentration of ammonia nitrogen, microbial CP, and total volatile fatty acids in the rumen showed a significant linear decrease in Stage 2. Among serum metabolism indexes, the insulin-like growth factor-1 decreased linearly (P < 0.01), while creatinine increased linearly with the increasing WS inclusion (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, serum total protein tends to decrease linearly in Stage 2 (P < 0.01). These findings highlight the international relevance of wheat silage as a sustainable forage alternative in intensive livestock systems worldwide. In summary, feeding a total mixed ration containing 36% wheat silage instead of alfalfa hay improved growth performance and nutrient digestibility, offering a viable solution for sustainable lamb production globally.",

LAT1 has emerged as a key therapeutic target in cancer due to its upregulation in different tumor types. We generated and characterized LAT1- and LAT2-expressing cells using the human MDST8 cell line lacking these transporters to evaluate the specificity and selectivity of the clinical candidate JPH203 and novel LAT1 inhibitors. Both LAT1 and LAT2 increased the expression of 4F2hc, a heavy chain protein essential for LAT1 functioning and AA transport. We show for the first time that two potent nanomolar LAT1 inhibitors, JPH203 and JX-078, can enter cells through LAT1-independent mechanisms and inhibit LAT1-mediated L-leucine efflux, giving rise to differential cell type and time-dependent effects on the AA metabolome and metabolic activity in cancer cells and human PBMCs. Intriguingly, the antiproliferative effects of JPH203 and JX-078 on MDST8 cells were LAT1-independent, showing also micromolar IC50 values in HT-29 and U937 cells that overexpress LAT1. We found notable differences in the bioavailability of LAT1 inhibitors in mice. Oral administration of JX-078 efficiently penetrated tissues and crossed the blood-brain barrier, leading to increased levels of inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA in the brain. This study demonstrates the utility of employing targeted metabolomics to interrogate LAT1/2 inhibitor selectivity in different physiological matrices in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.

The purpose of the study was to select three types of microbes based on macroscopic properties and nutrient content of fermented pangasius waste (FPW). In the first stage, the fermentation of pangasius waste with eight species of microbes (three of bacteria, three of fungi, and two of yeast) is cultured in a single fermentation solid-state medium. Each type of microbe that produces the highest number of colonies and nutrient content of FPW products in a single culture is then selected and used for consortium culture. The study used the nested, completely randomized design method, and the data were analyzed with ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test. The results of single cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), Rhizopus microsporus (Rm), and Yarrowia lipolytica (Yl) produced the best FPW products at 4 days of fermentation. The results of a consortium P. aeruginosa, R. microsporus, and Y. lipolytica (Pa + Rm + Yl) at a dose of 15% and fermentation for 4 days produced the best macroscopic physical properties, and its effect on nutrient content, obtained at a dose of 15% and fermentation for 4 days (protein 52.02%, fat 29.24%, and crude fiber 2.19%).

Several of these amino acid changes have been associated with reduced dependency on the principal angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for cell entry. The present study investigates the role of spike protein changes observed in a cell-culture adapted SARS-CoV-2 isolate (DK-AHH1) in modulating entry, ACE2 dependency, and neutralization across different cells, including human liver and lung cell lines. Using a pseudoparticle system, spike proteins with substitutions E484D, P812R, Q954H, and deletion Δ68-76 were evaluated in Vero E6 and Huh7.5, as well as in A549 cells with and without ACE2 overexpression. Pseudoparticles carrying E484D or P812R individually permitted entry in Huh7.5 cells, and their combination further enhanced this capacity. ACE2 blocking experiments revealed the differential roles of these mutations in mediating entry across cell lines. In Vero E6 cells, P812R was the primary driver for ACE2-independent entry, while E484D facilitated ACE2-independent entry in Huh7.5 cells. In A549 cells, all three substitutions (E484D+P812R + Q954H) were required for ACE2-independent entry. Addition of the Δ68-76 deletion did not increase infectivity in any cell line. Notably, pseudoparticles carrying these mutations, maintained susceptibility to neutralization by convalescent plasma from subjects with COVID-19, regardless of the cell line used. These findings highlight the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 in utilizing alternative entry mechanisms across various cell types, with E484D and P812R playing critical roles in ACE2-independent entry in cell culture. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how SARS-CoV-2 can alter its receptor usage to ensure robust infectivity of human cell lines while preserving neutralization sensitivity, contributing to our understanding of viral evolution, and informing potential therapeutic strategies targeting viral entry.",

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zn deficiency induces a transcriptional response mediated by the Zap1 activator, which controls a regulon of ∼80 genes. A subset support Zn homeostasis by promoting Zn uptake and its distribution between compartments, while the remainder mediate an 'adaptive response' to enhance fitness of Zn deficient cells. The peroxiredoxin Tsa1 is a Zap1-regulated adaptive factor essential for the growth of Zn deficient yeast. Tsa1 can function as an antioxidant peroxidase, protein chaperone, or redox sensor: the latter activity oxidizes associated proteins via a redox relay mechanism. We previously reported that in Zn deficient cells, Tsa1 inhibits pyruvate kinase (Pyk1) to conserve phosphoenolpyruvate for aromatic amino acid synthesis. However, this regulation makes a relatively minor contribution to fitness in low Zn, suggesting that Tsa1 targets other pathways important to adaptation. Consistent with this model, the redox sensor function of Tsa1 was essential for growth of ZnD cells. Using an MBP-tagged version of Tsa1, we identified a redox-sensitive non-covalent interaction with Pyk1, and applied this system to identify multiple novel interacting partners. This interactome implicates Tsa1 in the regulation of critical processes including many Zn-dependent metabolic pathways. Interestingly, Zap1 is a Tsa1 target, as Tsa1 strongly promoted the oxidation of Zap1 activation domain 2 and was required for full Zap1 activity. Our findings reveal a novel posttranslational response to Zn deficiency, overlain on and interconnected with the Zap1-mediated transcriptional response.",

In the past few years, TLR3 has been identified in a variety of fish, but its upstream adaptor is rarely reported. In this study, an adaptor protein, called WDFY1 (WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 1), was cloned and identified in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (CiWDFY1). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that fish WDFY1s are highly conserved and share a high level of sequence similarity to their mammalian counterparts. Particularly, CiWDFY1 is clustered in the same clade with that of crucian carp (Carassius auratus) and prussian carp (Carassius gibelio). CiWDFY1 is ubiquitously expressed in all detected tissues (eyes, intestines, gills, skin, liver, spleen, and kidney), but its expression is upregulated upon stimulation with poly(I:C). In CIK cells, over-expression of CiWDFY1 increases, while CiWDFY1 knockdown decreases the expression of IFN1. Subcellular localization assay revealed that CiWDFY1 is evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and yet it is congregated near the cytoplasmic membrane after poly(I:C) treatment. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays demonstrated that CiWDFY1 interacts with TLR3, and then TLR3 recruits TRIF and CiWDFY1 to form an activated complex, resulting in the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. However, CiWDFY1 knockdown hinders the physical interaction between TLR3 and TRIF, as well as the expression of IFN1. Taken together, CiWDFY1 serves as a scaffold protein to induce the expression of IFN1 in a TLR3-TRIF-IRF3-dependent pathway.",

It's bacteriocin Enterolysin_A exhibited strong molecular interactions with virulence-associated proteins of the mastitis pathogens. Thus, the promising probiotic potential and antimicrobial activity of E. faecium MBBL3, particularly against mastitis-related pathogens coupled with its safety profile, render it a promising candidate for further investigation.",

    "combined_text": "Insights into Caspase-6 Mutations and Neuropathology in Huntington's Disease and Psychiatric Disorders: A Structural Genomics and Drug Repurposing Approach.\n\nHuntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative condition that typically appears later in life, marked by progressive motor impairments, cognitive deterioration, and a range of psychiatric disturbances. Crucial to HD pathogenesis is the aberrant activation of caspase-6 (CASP6), which leads to the cleavage of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein, generating a toxic N-terminal fragment. CASP6 activity is elevated in human HD brains and is associated with the progression of neuropathology. This study aims to investigate the impact of deleterious mutations in CASP6 on the catalytic activity and stability of the protein. Identification of such mutations may be implicated in developing improved diagnostic approaches. Out of 225 single-point amino acid substitutions screened, 13 were found to be pathogenic and tend to form CASP6 aggregates. Among them, one mutation, F55V, was found in the highly conserved region, which may affect CASP6 function. We further employed a drug repurposing approach to identify potential CASP6 inhibitors for therapeutic development against HD. The integrated virtual screening and MD simulations analysis has suggested two repurposed drugs, Risperidone and Lorpiprazole, against CASP6. These results highlighted that targeting of CASP6 is a promising strategy for therapeutic management of HD and offers a starting point for designing novel interventions. As psychiatric symptoms in HD share neuropathological mechanisms with major psychiatric disorders, targeting CASP6 may provide insights into therapeutic strategies for both. These findings highlight CASP6 as a promising target for HD therapy and broader research in neuropsychiatric disorders. While this study is limited to computational modelling, it offers a valuable starting point for downstream experimental research.",

The intestinal absorption of α-tocopherol is in part carried out by Nieman-Pick1-like1 protein, which is the target of ezetimibe, a drug used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Ezetimibe is frequently prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes in combination with statins. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of ezetimibe treatment on the blood level of α-tocopherol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients affected by type 2 diabetes, regularly attending the diabetes clinic, were recruited. All patients should not have received vitamin supplements in the six months preceding the study. α-tocopherol was measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. Other laboratory parameters were determined by standard laboratory procedures. Patients were analyzed according to ezetimibe treatment. A linear multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the factors associated with α-tocopherol level. RESULTS: The majority of patients were on ezetimibe/statin treatment. Patients taking ezetimibe showed a significantly lower α-tocopherol level, 29.9±5.7 vs. 32.9±7.0 μmol/L (p=0.006) compared to those not taking the drug. Ezetimibe was significantly and negatively associated with α-tocopherol level in the multivariate analysis (β standardized coefficient = -.217, p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ezetimibe can reduce α-tocopherol plasma levels by inhibiting the Niemann-Pick C1-like protein. Future studies are required to address the clinical implications of this finding.\n\nhttps://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Graphical-Abstract-NEW-2-scaled.jpg.",

Albeit a growing interest in using mobile apps for health promotion, there is a need for comprehensive evidence on the effects of mobile apps, particularly on dietary behaviors.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of mobile app-based dietary interventions among cancer survivors and explore the potential mobile app features worth incorporating.\n\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science from inception to September 2023 without language restriction. We identified studies that used mobile apps for dietary interventions as a major module for cancer survivors. In addition, 2 independent reviewers screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality using Cochrane's risk of bias tools for randomized trials (RoB 2) and nonrandomized studies (ROBINS-I). A meta-analysis was conducted on body weight, BMI, nutritional outcomes, and quality of life using random-effects models.\n\nOf the 2621 records identified, 22 studies involving 1204 cancer survivors were included. Notably, existing trials involved only breast and gastrointestinal cancer survivors. Preliminary evidence suggested that mobile app-based dietary interventions demonstrated a beneficial effect on energy intake (Hedges g=1.00, 95% CI 0.96-1.03) and weight changes (Hedges g=-0.43, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.41); as well as a potential to improve protein intake and quality of life among gastrointestinal cancer survivors. The usability, quality, and satisfaction of app use as measured by standardized questionnaires, including the System Usability Scale, the Mobile Application Rating Scale, and the Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction, were positive. While feedback messages and dietary goal setting were considered facilitators of mobile app use, concerns regarding the time required for app use and limited food logging options were raised.\n\nOur review found the preliminary efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of mobile app-based dietary interventions for cancer survivors. However, study heterogeneity should be recognized. More trials are warranted to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions and explore any differences based on cancer types, staging, treatment statuses, the mode of communication with dietitians, and the engagement of family or caregivers. Existing mobile apps could maintain important features such as feedback messages and dietary goal setting while considering the incorporation of artificial intelligence-powered food recognition in food logging and cancer-specific dietary recommendations.",

The nanofibers (IM/F@IS) enabling the simultaneous delivery of indomethacin and insulin were prepared such that when incorporated into 3T3-L1 spheroids, they significantly enhanced adipogenic differentiation (an increase in the gene expression of FABP4 and adiponectin by 6.1 ± 0.2 and 11.2 ± 1.4 times, respectively) without exogenous differentiation supplements. Following encapsulation in UV-crosslinked gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels, cells from composite spheroids exhibited robust proliferation, migration, and maturation into functional adipocytes with substantial triglyceride accumulation and homogeneous lipid droplet distribution. Notably, these engineered constructs maintained structural integrity with minimal contraction following subcutaneous implantation in mice. We also confirmed that softer hydrogels significantly enhanced cell sprouting and expression of matrix remodeling proteins, collectively improving adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells within the hydrogel. This approach addresses the critical challenge of creating physiologically relevant adipose constructs with predefined dimensions by combining pre-adipocyte spheroids incorporating adipo-inductive fibers and GelMA hydrogels.",

We use small angle and ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and USAXS) along with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dynamic light scattering to reveal structural changes over time. We show that higher particle (2-5 wt%) and higher oil concentrations (40-70 wt%) can increase the stability and reduce the rate of phase separation of the emulsion over time. We also show that aging (shelf storage) over a period of 90 days induces different structural changes in the system. Our studies show SAXS to be an effective tool for studying such Pickering-particle based emulsions, giving insights into a system whose structure and behaviour resemble that of food grade emulsions.",

However, it remains unclear whether the encoded protein(s) (APOL1-RA) and HIV-1 Nef interact to induce podocyte cell death. Here, we generated transgenic flies that express APOL1-G1 (derived from a child with HIVAN) and HIV-1 nef specifically in the nephrocytes, the fly equivalent of mammalian podocytes, and assessed their individual and combined effects on the nephrocyte filtration structure and function. We found that HIV-1 Nef acts in synergy with APOL1-G1, resulting in nephrocyte structural and functional defects, and that Nef exacerbates the organelle acidification defects and autophagy reduction induced by APOL1-G1. The synergy between HIV-1 Nef and APOL1-G1 is built on their joint effects on elevating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, triggering nephrocyte dysfunction and, ultimately, cell death. Thus, we identified ER stress as the converging point for the synergy between HIV-1 Nef and APOL1-G1 in inducing nephrocyte cell death. Given the high similarity between Drosophila nephrocytes and human podocytes, our findings suggest ER stress as a new therapeutic target for HIV-1- and APOL1-associated nephropathies.",

Map-based cloning and whole-genome sequencing revealed that the mutant referred to here as lbr1 for LatB  resistant1 had a point mutation in the AT5G09810 gene, which encodes the vegetative actin (ACT) isoform ACT7. The cytosine to thymine mutation in exon two of lbr1 ACT7 led to substitution of proline to serine at position 34 (P34S) adjacent to the nucleotide-binding cleft of the ACT7 protein. Transgenic complementation with ACT7 wild type (ACT7WT) and ACT7 P34S (ACT7P34S) constructs confirmed that ACT7 is the causal gene for the lbr1 phenotype. ACT7P34S also rescued the seedling developmental defects and conferred partial resistance to LatB in recessive act7-5 mutants. Furthermore, expressing a P34S mutation in ACT2 (ACT2P34S), another vegetative ACT isoform, conferred partial LatB resistance to wild type. However, lbr1 roots were not resistant to other treatments that inhibit growth.

Furthermore, FA was found to reduce the release of particulate matters such as histamine and mast cell proteinase. Transcriptomic analysis provided evidence that FA intervention could reverse gene expression changes induced by food allergies. The gene Hsp90, responsible for producing heat shock proteins (HSP), emerged as a potential key gene involved in the process. In vitro RBL-2H3 cell-based assays suggested that FA might affect HSP90 expression through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), leading to a reduction in effector cell degranulation. Overall, the results of this study indicate that FA has an alleviating effect on food allergies, with high doses of FA exhibiting more pronounced effects.

In March 2024, a first-time outbreak of HPAIV H5N1 in dairy cattle herds was reported in the United States (US). Since then, the virus has continued to spread in cattle herds and spilt over into humans. We recently showed that the first human isolate reported in the US in Texas (HPhTX) from a dairy worker in an affected cattle farm has enhanced replication kinetics and pathogenicity in mice compared to a closely related bovine isolate (HPbTX). However, the molecular determinants of differential pathogenicity have not yet been identified. Herein, we show that HPhTX has enhanced polymerase activity, compared with HPbTX, in human cells and that the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein is the main factor responsible for this difference. Through single and combined site-directed mutagenesis and swapping the three amino acids different between HPhTX and HPbTX, we found that PB2 mutation E627 K is the major contributor to the enhanced polymerase activity of HPhTX. E362G substitution in HPhTX PB2 affected the polymerase, although to a lesser extent than E627 K. Moreover, M631L mutation in HPhTX PB2 enhanced polymerase activity. Rescue of a loss-of-function recombinant HPhTX (rHPhTX) containing mutations at residues 627 and 362, alone or in combination, revealed a contribution of PB2 E362G and K627E in morbidity, mortality, and viral replication as compared to rHPhTX wild-type (WT), and significantly reduced viral pathogenicity to levels comparable to rHPbTX WT. These findings indicate that HPAIV H5N1 of cattle origin isolated from the first human case has post-transmission amino acid changes that increase viral replication in human cells and pathogenicity in mice.",

For emulsion-based foods, stability is essential to preserve their nutritional value, texture, appearance, and flavor.

AKH/HrTH are important peptidergic metabolic regulators in insects that are crucial to provide energy during periods of high output mobility or when large amounts of energy-rich substrates are synthesized (for example, during vitellogenesis). AKH functions via a G protein-coupled receptor. Understanding which residue of the peptide (the ligand), activates the receptor with high efficacy is an important step to get insights into the ligand-receptor interaction, which is essential for further research on creating a model of how the ligand behaves in the binding pocket of the receptor. Such data are necessary for the search of non-peptidic mimetic agonists or antagonists in pesticide design.\n\nUsing bioinformatics and cloning techniques, the complete coding sequence of an AKH receptor was cloned and sequenced from fat body tissues and nervous tissues from the Indian stick insect,\n\nThe stick insect AKH receptor was successfully cloned and sequenced from fat body and, separately, from nervous tissues. Comparison with known insect AKH, Crz and ACP receptors clearly put the stick insect receptor in the AKH clade and as sister group to other putative Phasmatodean AKH receptors. Moreover, the receptor expressed in mammalian cells was only activated by AKH and not by Crz or ACP indicating a true AKH receptor. Structure-activity studies in an Ala replacement series revealed the ligand residues that are absolutely essential for activating the AKHR: the N-terminal pGlu, Phe\n\nThe AKH receptor from stick insects (Phasmatodea) cluster together in one clade distinct from other insect AKHRs, although still similar enough to be an insect AKHR, as opposed to the other GnRH-related receptors of insects, such as ACP and Crz receptors. The phylogenetic analyses support the data obtained from other studies involving receptors for AKH, Crz and ACP peptides.

It is therefore important to find new and sustainable sources of protein. Compared to traditional animal-derived proteins, insect-derived proteins have higher sustainability and a smaller ecological footprint. In addition, considering that older adults have an anabolic resistance and that protein intake strongly stimulates skeletal muscle protein synthesis, insect-derived proteins may play a potential role in promoting healthy aging. Based on this, this review systematically analyzes the essential amino acid profile, nutritional value, protein digestibility and absorption, health benefits and potential risks, as well as the acceptability and environmental impact of edible insects. Overall, adding insect-derived protein to the diet helps maintain skeletal muscle mass and function in aging, improves gut health, and lowers the risk of age-related diseases. In future research, it is still necessary to improve processing and preparation techniques and establish explicit legal provisions to ensure the safety and acceptability of insect-derived proteins.",

Adolescents, especially girls, are at a heightened risk due to increased iron requirements during growth and menstruation. Objective This study aimed to estimate the hospital prevalence of ID and IDA among adolescent girls attending the Outpatient Department (OPD) at a tertiary care centre in Bihar, India. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, India, from June 2019 to October 2021. A total of 169 adolescent girls aged 10 to 19 years were recruited using a non-probability convenient sampling method. Participants with normal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were included to ensure accurate assessment of iron status, without the influence of inflammation. Serum ferritin, hemoglobin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and percentage saturation were measured. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of ID (serum ferritin < 15 µg/L) and IDA (serum ferritin < 15 µg/L and hemoglobin < 12 g/dL). Results The hospital prevalence of ID among the study participants was 17.8% (95% CI: 11.8%-23.5%), while the hospital prevalence of IDA was 15.4% (95% CI: 10.1%-21.7%). The overall hospital prevalence of anemia was 47.9% (95% CI: 40.2%-53.8%). A higher hospital prevalence of ID and IDA was observed in older adolescents (aged 17-19 years) compared to younger ones (aged 10-16 years), though the association was not significant (p = 0.056). Conclusions The findings of this study revealed that almost half of the adolescent girl population had a high hospital prevalence of anemia, with the majority of these cases classified as mild to moderate in intensity, whereas the hospital prevalence of absolute ID and IDA was low. Early screening using serum ferritin and appropriate nutritional strategies is recommended to address this public health issue.",

Sequence analysis revealed that these strains exhibited a sequence identity of 59.8%-100% in the capsid protein. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that global PAstV3 strains could be classified into four genotypes: PAstV3a-d. The intergenotype strains showed nucleotide (nt) and amino acid sequence identities of 59.7%-69.8% and 59.5%-72.0%, respectively, in the ORF2 region.

They can serve as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers for various diseases, offering novel avenues for diagnosis and treatment.

Aims: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2018. This study investigates the associations of the dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM), dietary inflammatory index (DII), and their combined effects with MASLD/MetALD, while exploring the mediating roles of inflammation and metabolic dysfunction.\n\nData from the 2007 to 2018 NHANES included 9,529 participants. DI-GM and DII were calculated using 24-hour dietary recalls. Inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers-including triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, metabolic score (MS), C-reactive protein (CRP), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI)-were analyzed. Multivariable logistic and linear regression, subgroup analyses, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models assessed associations and dose-response relationships. Mediation analysis evaluated the roles of inflammatory and metabolic markers.\n\nHigher DI-GM scores were significantly associated with reduced MASLD (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.46-0.75) and MetALD (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.46-0.70). Conversely, higher DII scores were positively associated with MASLD (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.23-2.01) and MetALD (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.13-1.75). DI-GM was inversely associated with inflammation and metabolic markers (TyG: β= -0.05, MS: β= -0.11, CRP: β= -0.12, SII: β= -0.08, SIRI: β= -0.09), while DII exacerbated these markers (TyG: β= 0.06, MS: β= 0.18, CRP: β=0.14, SII: β= 0.11, SIRI: β= 0.10). The combined effects of DI-GM and DII further demonstrated that a gut microbiota-healthy and anti-inflammatory diet synergistically reduced MASLD (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43-0.81) and MetALD risks (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44-0.76). Mediation analysis confirmed that inflammation and metabolism significantly mediated the diet-disease associations (p < 0.05).\n\nHigher DI-GM and lower DII are associated with reduced MASLD/MetALD risks, partially mediated by alleviating systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. These findings highlight dietary interventions targeting gut microbiota and inflammation as strategies for early prevention of MASLD and MetALD.",

Presynaptic protein loss has been shown to be especially strong in patients, though not all proteins and brain areas are affected equally.ObjectiveTo investigate whether presynaptic protein loss is similarly heterogenous in non-clinical AD models, a meta-analysis was conducted in rodent models of the disease.MethodsPubMed, Embase, and Medline databases were searched for publications measuring presynaptic markers in AD rodent model brains between 2015-2023. A total of 1333 records arose from the searches, and these were screened for suitable studies. Meta-analyses on global presynaptic protein changes, protein-, area- and model-specific effects amongst others were performed on 184 studies. Studies employing proteomic approaches for protein quantification were analyzed separately from non-proteomic studies.ResultsRobust and significant global loss of presynaptic proteins was observed in these animal models. The effect size varied between different model types, with the greatest effects being observed in models in which either tau was genetically modified or where amyloid-β injection was used. The greatest severity was seen in hippocampal subregions and for proteins associated with the vesicle release machinery (SNARE proteins).ConclusionsProteomic studies confirmed that presynaptic proteins were most frequently lower in AD models relative to control, although some proteins were increased. Multiple presynaptic proteins were found to be altered in proteomic meta-analysis and some of these may constitute putative biomarkers that warrant further investigation.",

The time-intensive process and high costs further limit the development of therapeutics. Therefore, this research aimed to identify FDA-approved drugs that inhibit three proteins (Casein kinase 1, Protein tyrosine kinase 2, Ephrin type-A receptor 4) associated with ALS.\n\nA machine learning (ML) model was trained for each protein to identify an inputted compound as an active inhibitor of that protein.

The results were validated through protein-ligand docking of each drug to its respective protein(s).\n\nRisperidone was the most active drug, with an average ML score of 1 and binding affinity of -8.9. The ML scores and binding affinities had a strong correlation, indicating reliability.\n\nThis research predicted multiple drugs that can simultaneously target many proteins involved in ALS, creating more effective treatment options at a lower cost.

To identify nutritional attributes and compare different germplasm accessions, we conducted comparative transcriptomic and proteomic studies on a total of five quinoa accessions. These include four accessions from different genetic groups representing dry valleys, dry highlands, transition areas, and humid valleys in the Northwest Argentina region (NWA), as well as QQ74, a sequenced Chilean coastal accession.\n\nWe analyzed the quinoa seed transcriptome of four different accessions by aligning the RNA-seq results with the second version of the QQ74 genome (QQ74-V2).

A Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these DEGs showed that the accession representing the NWA transition area was enriched in terms related to oxidative phosphorylation and heat response. Furthermore, using 2D-gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that storage proteins, specifically 11S globulin, 13S globulin and vicilin-like antimicrobial peptides, were the most abundant proteins in quinoa seeds of the five accessions.

This study aimed to assess the combined impact of high-fat diet (HFD), alcohol, and fructose intake on liver injury and iron metabolism. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (5‒7 weeks old, weighing 160‒180 g) were randomly assigned to three groups: regular chow, HFD, and a combined HFD with 30% ethanol and 30% fructose (HF‒EFr), and were maintained for 4 or 8 weeks. Liver injury was assessed via histopathological staining and serum aminotransferase levels. Iron homeostasis was evaluated by measuring plasma iron levels, hepatic iron deposition, and the expression of key iron-regulatory proteins. Markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and macrophage activation, such as CD14, ED-1 (CD68), HIF1α, and STAT3 activation, were also examined. Urinary levels of ferritin-L and lipocalin-2 were measured. The HF‒EFr group exhibited severe liver injury, characterized by steatohepatitis and hepatocyte ballooning, with significantly elevated serum aminotransaminase levels and a decrease in the AST/ALT ratio from 3:1 at week 4 to 2:1 at week 8, indicative of progressive hepatocellular damage. Increased serum CD14 and hepatic ED-1 (CD68) confirmed macrophage activation. Urinary ferritin-L and lipocalin-2 levels increased significantly compared with other groups, indicating systemic inflammation and renal involvement. In the HF‒EFr group, gene expression of ferroportin and ferritin was upregulated, accompanied by plasma iron depletion and increased hepatic iron deposition. Nuclear localization of ferritin subunits in hepatocytes was observed, along with elevated HIF-1α and cytokine levels, and activation of STAT3, suggesting an oxidative stress response in the HF‒EFr group. Chronic consumption of alcohol and fructose intensifies the dysregulation of iron metabolism and liver injury induced by a high-fat diet. These findings highlight the critical role of iron homeostasis in diet-induced liver disease and suggest that urinary biomarkers such as ferritin-L and lipocalin-2 may serve as noninvasive indicators of systemic inflammation and iron dysregulation.

The crystal structure of the designer tri-zinc enzyme verifies the accuracy of our design process based on geometry optimizations and quantum-chemical calculations. The extrinsic catalytic performance of this designer enzyme is of the highest class and comparable to that of previously reported designer zinc hydrolases. Importantly, an intrinsic function of MIF, i.e., its tautomerase activity, is maintained in this designer tri-zinc enzyme. Considering that cytokines are originally expressed in response to in vivo events, this cytokine-based designer metalloenzyme holds promising potential as a synthetic biological tool for the self-adaptive regulation of life phenomena.",

These competing factors have resulted in contradictory observations of membrane elasticity across different measurement scales, requiring chemical specificity to explain incompatible structural and elastic effects. Here, we demonstrate that - unlike macroscopic observations - lipid membranes exhibit a unified elastic behavior in the mesoscopic regime between molecular and macroscopic dimensions. Using nuclear spin techniques and computational analysis, we find that mesoscopic bending moduli follow a universal dependence on the lipid packing density regardless of cholesterol content, lipid unsaturation, or temperature. Our observations reveal that compositional complexity can be explained by simple biophysical laws that directly map membrane elasticity to molecular packing associated with biological function, curvature transformations, and protein interactions. The obtained scaling laws closely align with theoretical predictions based on conformational chain entropy and elastic stress fields. These findings provide unique insights into the membrane design rules optimized by nature and unlock predictive capabilities for guiding the functional performance of lipid-based materials in synthetic biology and real-world applications.",

    "combined_text": "Polypeptides synthesized by common bacteria in the human gut improve rodent metabolism.\n\nThe human gut microbiota has the potential to synthesize proteins that may influence host metabolism. Here we report two polypeptides, RUMTOR-derived peptide (RORDEP) 1 and RORDEP2, circulating in human blood and synthesized by specific strains of gut commensal Ruminococcus torques that correlate inversely with adiposity in humans. Oral gavage with RORDEP-expressing strains improved glucose tolerance, increased bone density and reduced fat mass with an enhanced expression of genes and proteins involved in thermogenesis and lipolysis in lean mice on a high-fat diet and diet-induced obese mice. Recombinant RORDEP1 given to rats intraperitoneally decreased plasma gastric inhibitory polypeptide but increased glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY and insulin. Intestinal delivery of recombinant RORDEP1 to rats potentiated insulin-mediated inhibition of hepatic glucose production by downregulating genes and proteins controlling liver gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and lipogenesis but upregulating those involved in insulin signalling, glycogenesis and glycolysis. These preclinical findings warrant the exploration of RORDEPs for the prevention and treatment of human metabolic disorders.",

    "combined_text": "Fast and easy edible protein production by nitrogen-supplemented koji fermentation.\n\nThe continuous increase in the global population has led to a rise in the demand for protein. However, conventional meat production has adverse environmental effects. Thus, developing alternative ways to produce edible protein with high efficiency and low cost is necessary. In this study, a novel protein production process was developed based on traditional koji fermentation, i.e., solid-state Aspergillus oryzae cultivation on grains. By supplementing nitrogen sources into rice and maize grains, the protein content of fermented products reached to 12.3% and 13.2% and the amount of total protein was increased to 2.32-fold and 1.58-fold, respectively. In addition, koji fermentation enhanced the content of lysine, which is the limiting amino acid for humans and livestock. Nitrogen-supplemented koji fermentation is a practical technology for the quick protein enrichment of cereal grains without the need for advanced facilities, indicating its great application potential in alleviating the anticipated global shortage of protein-rich foods.",
