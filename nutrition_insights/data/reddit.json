    "combined_text": "Title: It's not just about calories\n\nPost: I've noticed that in many nutrition discussions, people focus on macronutrients and calories, but far less attention is given to how well those nutrients are absorbed. Two people can eat exactly the same foods yet have completely different outcomes in terms of energy, digestion, or body composition.\n\nI started working with JM Nutrition, a group of registered nutritionists here in Canada, to understand why, in my case, certain meal plans didn't produce the same results I saw in others. It was eye-opening to discover that factors like digestive health, food combinations, stress levels, and even medical history can greatly influence how the body processes and utilizes nutrients.\n\nOne concrete example I experienced was with protein intake. After making a few diet adjustments recommended by them, my digestion and muscle recovery improved noticeably, even though the total amount of protein stayed the same. The difference came from how I combined the foods and the timing of when I consumed them.\n\nI think it's worth paying more attention not just to what we eat, but also to how and how well the body uses it.\n\nComments:\nIf you control for LBM, bodyfat %, and activity, the differences are negligible\n\nOp: it's not just about calories\n\nAlso Op: it's all about calories (but he doesn't realize it yet so takes the long way)\n\nI regret to inform you if you're trying to lose or gain weight, it is all about calories, everything else is cope.

I’ve been working 8ish hour shifts where I have very little ability to bring food that needs refrigerated / reheat food. There’s vending machines and a cafeteria but I don’t have access to the cafeteria every day and don’t want to waste my money when I do and also don’t want to waste my money on super unhealthy vending machine snacks. \n\nDoes anyone have any creative ideas on alternative snacks to bring to work? I had been bringing some kind of  protein bar + a healthier snack each day but it’s really been messing with my digestive system. This week I’ve brought a peanut butter jelly apple sandwiches + a piece of fruit and this has been a lot better, but does anyone have any suggestions for alternatives that would be fine in my backpack (and possibly the heat) for a few hours? It’s a very physically job and I don’t have the time or ability to really eat a full meal but I need a few things to keep my energy up throughout the shift. \n\nI was thinking about making some oat pancakes to switch it up, but would these be all right after sitting out for a few hours?

    "combined_text": "Title: How Does Protein Effect a Wourkout Time-wise?\n\nPost: I will preface this by saying that I understand that a constant good diet and constant workout/exercise is best. I am asking just to better understand how the protein helps.\n\nIf I were to work out one time, and have only one day that i have a high protein meal, would it be best to have that meal the night before a workout, the day of the workout, or the day after the workout? So im asking if its the protein already in your system (day before), or the protein that's starting digestion (day of), or the protein while sore and in recovery (day after), that has the largest effect on muscle growth? \n\nAgain, im asking solely to understand how protein actually affects muscle growth, not looking to only eat protein once every 3 days or looking for diet advice, thanks!\n\nComments:\nBarely matters at all as long as you supply your body with enough of all the amino acids it needs. The most important factor that determines the hypertrophy you're going to get is whether or not your workout created the molecular signal to trigger hypertrophy, and that's going to be much more dependant on your glycogen status (how depleted or glycogen loaded you are), which is going to impact your performance and thus the hypertrophy stimulus you can generate, and your carbohydrate intake is going to determine this (obviously depends on a variety of other factors not related to diet). If you create the stimulus and the protein is there, the fibers must and will grow\n\nProtein timing has a teeny tiny impact on growth, it's mostly marketing and nerd min/maxing.\n\nIf you can have a shake post work out, do it.\n\nIf not, it's not worth changing your day to make it happen.\n\nSo it’s very complicated and it’s impossible to say exactly what’s happening, but probably easiest to think of it this way:\n\nThe total amount of protein per day you have is your stored protein.

    "combined_text": "Title: Why are beans and legumes so inconsistent in nutritional value across different brands?\n\nPost: Has anyone else noticed that there is no consistency in the nutritional values of beans? As an example, I have Thrive Market dried red lentils, which have 100 calories, 9g protein, and 8g fiber per serving. That's 1g protein per every ~11 calories. But then a bag of Goya dried red lentils is 160 calories, 11g protein, 5g fiber. Lower fiber and 1g of protein per every ~14 calories. \n\nNot just lentils either. I have Iberia red kidney beans, which are 70 calories, 9g protein, 14g fiber per serving (1g protein per 8 calories). Goya's label for the same beans says 140 calories, 9g protein, 6g fiber (1g protein per 16 calories). Way less protein and fiber than Iberia. \n\nAnd this is across so many other brands too, different for every brand, different for canned vs. dried. What's the deal??\n\nI'd like to point out that I know the serving sizes vary across each product, but that doesn't explain why the calorie to protein and calorie to fiber ratio is so different. \n\nComments:\nBasically, it's because the FDA allows a certain amount of rounding.

      "When eaten as part of a mixed meal, the glycemic impact is often reduced. Rice is usually eaten as part of a whole meal with fats, proteins, and fiber from other foods. \n\nIt's also a different kind of sugar. Rice has glucose, which enters the bloodstream right away and is regulated by the liver. Sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose. Fructose goes straight to the liver. It bypasses some of the control steps that glucose has, so large amounts can lead to increased fat production in the liver.",
      "White rice isn’t a nutrient dense food, but it does have other nutrients like protein and a small amount of fiber.  It in has all 9 essential amino acids, but only very low amounts of Lysine, luckily, legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc) are a high protein food with a high amount of lysine but low in methionine.  Rice happens to have a high amount of. Which is why you often hear beans and rice form a complete protein. Individually neither rice nor legumes are a complete protein, but together they are. While sugar contains no protein/amino acids. \n\nBut to answer your question, functionally, eating rice is not the same as eating sugar. For starters, sugar is more than three times more calorically dense than rice. You have to eat more than 300g of rice to reach the same amount of carbohydrates as 100g of sugar. The volume makes a difference in satiation. 100g of sugar will give you the calories, but will not signal to your brain you’re full, so you continue feel hungry and crave more food. Rice is also a neutral food, which means it can be eaten with other food, to make it more filling. \n\nAdditionally, consider the starch in rice transforms into resistant starch once cooked, cooled and reheated, and act more like fiber than starch during the digestive process, which not only triggers a lower glycemic response, it’s is also beneficial to your gut microbiome.\n\nSo while you can get the same values of carbohydrate from rice and sugar, rice is more versatile and more nutritious when eaten with other foods, because it complements the nutritional profiles of especially other plant based protein sources.",
      "Why health-conscious people avoid processed sugar but not white rice:\n\nWhite rice (despite being a high-glycemic carb) is often paired with nutrient-dense foods (vegetables, proteins, fats) in balanced meals, slowing digestion and glycemic impact. \n\nProcessed sugar is typically consumed in isolation (soda, candy) or in nutrient-poor foods, which spikes blood sugar rapidly.\n\nIf you look into cultural dietary patterns, rice-based cultures (e.g., Asian) often have balanced diets w/ vegetables, lean proteins, and lower processed food intake, unlike sugar-heavy Western diets.",
      "Fructose. It is all fructose. Your body has limited ability to clear fructose. Sugar has a fructose and a glucose molecule. The fructose is the bad guy if your body has too much. It must be processed in the liver, unlike glucose.",
      "Rice fills glycogen stores and [glycogen] carbs are beneficial for performance and hypertrophy \n\nSugar contains fructose which is metabolized in the liver and has less beneficial properties than glycogen, but it still helps fill liver glycogen which is beneficial for endurance athletes \n\nBlood sugar spikes are not unhealthy, and are actually beneficial for “shuttling” nutrients. \n\nThis sub is is filled with people that focus on eating for “longevity” and not athletic performance, so a lot of comments you read are from people that have no idea what they’re talking about and demonize certain foods. There are no bad carbohydrates, just mistimed applications \n\nSimple carbs are usually preferred sources from athletes because they are easier to digest, which doesn’t interfere with workouts (stomach issues)",
      "White rice has much more than just carbs unlike white sugar.  \nBut yeah, white rice is still vastly nutritionally inferior to whole.  \n\nAn unsaid benefit of white rice is it is low in fiber so it is interesting when you don't want GI troubles during a long race for example. It is superior for carbs loading than pasta.",
      "I'd argue that when you eat white rice, you must chew that food which causes neurological signals from the masseters to signal food being eaten so you cant eat as much rice as you can sugar. Also, amylase is being released when you eat rice which may also have a rate limiting effect.\n\n\nThe simplest answer though is the more isolated and refined a macro is (and this goes for whey isolate too) the completely different effect it will have on the body than the initial food in complete form would, even if it too is high in the macro being consumed.",
      "I’m confused as to why you don’t think rice has micro-nutrients.  Please look that up, it absolutely has fiber, protein, vitamins & minerals.",

    "combined_text": "Title: Confused about Rice vs Processed sugar\n\nPost: If white rice and processed sugar are both high glycemic carbs with little to no micro nutrients why do people who are into health and fitness often avoid one and praise the other? \n\nIs the fact that white rice is complex carb matter if it's still high glycemic \n\nWhy are cultures who's diet is mainly white rice seem so much healthier than cultures and countries who's diets are high in sugar, is it correlation or causation?\n\nIf an athlete who eats white rice with most meals replaces his rice with an equivalents amount (in terms of macros) sugar water and drinks it together with his fats and proteins, would his performance stay the same or go down?\n\nDo we have long term studies comparing a high rice vs high sugar diet that take into account the rest of the persons diet? To figure out the correlation vs causation issue from earlier \n\nIf a person cuts out all refined sugar but continues eating rice with most meals would there still be positive effects?\n\n\n\nComments:\nWhen eaten as part of a mixed meal, the glycemic impact is often reduced. Rice is usually eaten as part of a whole meal with fats, proteins, and fiber from other foods. \n\nIt's also a different kind of sugar. Rice has glucose, which enters the bloodstream right away and is regulated by the liver. Sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose. Fructose goes straight to the liver. It bypasses some of the control steps that glucose has, so large amounts can lead to increased fat production in the liver.\n\nWhite rice isn’t a nutrient dense food, but it does have other nutrients like protein and a small amount of fiber.  It in has all 9 essential amino acids, but only very low amounts of Lysine, luckily, legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc) are a high protein food with a high amount of lysine but low in methionine.  Rice happens to have a high amount of. Which is why you often hear beans and rice form a complete protein. Individually neither rice nor legumes are a complete protein, but together they are. While sugar contains no protein/amino acids. \n\nBut to answer your question, functionally, eating rice is not the same as eating sugar. For starters, sugar is more than three times more calorically dense than rice. You have to eat more than 300g of rice to reach the same amount of carbohydrates as 100g of sugar. The volume makes a difference in satiation. 100g of sugar will give you the calories, but will not signal to your brain you’re full, so you continue feel hungry and crave more food. Rice is also a neutral food, which means it can be eaten with other food, to make it more filling. \n\nAdditionally, consider the starch in rice transforms into resistant starch once cooked, cooled and reheated, and act more like fiber than starch during the digestive process, which not only triggers a lower glycemic response, it’s is also beneficial to your gut microbiome.\n\nSo while you can get the same values of carbohydrate from rice and sugar, rice is more versatile and more nutritious when eaten with other foods, because it complements the nutritional profiles of especially other plant based protein sources.\n\nWhy health-conscious people avoid processed sugar but not white rice:\n\nWhite rice (despite being a high-glycemic carb) is often paired with nutrient-dense foods (vegetables, proteins, fats) in balanced meals, slowing digestion and glycemic impact. \n\nProcessed sugar is typically consumed in isolation (soda, candy) or in nutrient-poor foods, which spikes blood sugar rapidly.\n\nIf you look into cultural dietary patterns, rice-based cultures (e.g., Asian) often have balanced diets w/ vegetables, lean proteins, and lower processed food intake, unlike sugar-heavy Western diets.\n\nFructose. It is all fructose. Your body has limited ability to clear fructose. Sugar has a fructose and a glucose molecule. The fructose is the bad guy if your body has too much. It must be processed in the liver, unlike glucose.\n\nRice fills glycogen stores and [glycogen] carbs are beneficial for performance and hypertrophy \n\nSugar contains fructose which is metabolized in the liver and has less beneficial properties than glycogen, but it still helps fill liver glycogen which is beneficial for endurance athletes \n\nBlood sugar spikes are not unhealthy, and are actually beneficial for “shuttling” nutrients. \n\nThis sub is is filled with people that focus on eating for “longevity” and not athletic performance, so a lot of comments you read are from people that have no idea what they’re talking about and demonize certain foods. There are no bad carbohydrates, just mistimed applications \n\nSimple carbs are usually preferred sources from athletes because they are easier to digest, which doesn’t interfere with workouts (stomach issues)\n\nWhite rice has much more than just carbs unlike white sugar.  \nBut yeah, white rice is still vastly nutritionally inferior to whole.  \n\nAn unsaid benefit of white rice is it is low in fiber so it is interesting when you don't want GI troubles during a long race for example. It is superior for carbs loading than pasta.\n\nI'd argue that when you eat white rice, you must chew that food which causes neurological signals from the masseters to signal food being eaten so you cant eat as much rice as you can sugar. Also, amylase is being released when you eat rice which may also have a rate limiting effect.\n\n\nThe simplest answer though is the more isolated and refined a macro is (and this goes for whey isolate too) the completely different effect it will have on the body than the initial food in complete form would, even if it too is high in the macro being consumed.\n\nI’m confused as to why you don’t think rice has micro-nutrients.  Please look that up, it absolutely has fiber, protein, vitamins & minerals.\n\nOmg.. whole food is always better for you than ultra-processed food. It's just better, and it's especially true for Carbs being a human body's main/favoured fuel source; The body gets addicted. Even pure fruit juice is liquid sugar and should be consumed strategically(before exercise), not mindlessly..\n\nThe amount of people on this sub trying to wiggle around, overthink it, use technicalities to defend processed sugars.. the paranoid part of me is thinking it's like their bots working for big business sugar, spreading misinformation on purpose- \"it's the same\", \"calories in calories out\" \"it's all technically carbohydrates, soo......\"\n\nI gotta block this sub.

      "Why are you eating keto in the first place? If you are a healthy weight, what is the benefit? Just eat a moderate diet.",
      "“Cheating” on keto will result in leaving ketosis (burning fat instead of glucose for energy), so yeah if you’re trying to eat keto it isn’t the best choice. \nThat said, eating keto is far from healthy by itself. The only benefit is to cut calories by eliminating carbs as an option and thereby create a caloric deficit to lose weight. It’s a short term strategy useful because the downsides of being overweight are worse overall. In the long term, eating keto inevitably results in overconsumption of saturated fat, which increases risk of atherosclerosis. Keep eating a high fat diet after you reach a healthy weight, and all you’ll do is get high blood pressure and clogged arteries.\nIt’s healthier to eat plenty of carbs from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains as well as lean sources of protein, while keeping your calories at maintenance levels.",
      "If you’re not too worried about glucose levels and staying in ketosis, the occasionally carb heavy day isn’t going to impact you negatively. You’ll probably find more benefit in just focusing on a very low carb diet generally with the occasional freedom to eat a bowl of pasta or pizza. \n\nThat’s what I did and the benefits were great. The only side effect is you will likely feel those carbs as heavy and may feel bloated for a couple days.",
      "Refeeds are important. Honestly. If you are fit and have been keto, it might not even kick you out of ketosis. Those carbs are going mostly straight to your muscle  and liver glycogen reserves. If anything, you’ll have a better work out tomorrow.  You can do some research on carb cycling.",
      "Not harmful only thing it will do is kick you off ketosis if you go past 80g of carbs. If your goal is to stay In ketosis just gotta cut back again you’ll be back In a few days.",

    "combined_text": "Title: I’ve been eating Keto meals for the past 2-3 weeks and I’m about to have a cheat meal.\n\nPost: For reference, I’m a 31 yo male who’s in shape. I regularly go to the gym and lift weights/kettle bell workouts. In the past I’ve eaten out a lot and would eat a lot of high carb meals, my metabolism is pretty fast so I’ve never gained too much weight. \n\nI’ve gotten a lot leaner on keto and have felt great. I’ve been invited to a meal tonight of fried calamari and French fries. \n\nThis motivated me to do some more research on keto and I’m reading that it can be really bad to have cheat meals. I don’t NEED to do keto since I’m generally pretty healthy, but I do like the benefits. As well as the creative meals, like pork grind and cream cheese/shredded cheese crust pizza.  \n\nMy question is - is it harmful to eat Keto meals while also consuming regular meals every now and then? Like protein pasta one night, then a keto pizza the next?\n\nComments:\nThe term *cheat meal* needs to get out of society’s vocabulary. How’s your cholesterol?\n\nWhy are you eating keto in the first place? If you are a healthy weight, what is the benefit? Just eat a moderate diet.\n\n“Cheating” on keto will result in leaving ketosis (burning fat instead of glucose for energy), so yeah if you’re trying to eat keto it isn’t the best choice. \nThat said, eating keto is far from healthy by itself. The only benefit is to cut calories by eliminating carbs as an option and thereby create a caloric deficit to lose weight. It’s a short term strategy useful because the downsides of being overweight are worse overall. In the long term, eating keto inevitably results in overconsumption of saturated fat, which increases risk of atherosclerosis. Keep eating a high fat diet after you reach a healthy weight, and all you’ll do is get high blood pressure and clogged arteries.\nIt’s healthier to eat plenty of carbs from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains as well as lean sources of protein, while keeping your calories at maintenance levels.\n\nIf you’re not too worried about glucose levels and staying in ketosis, the occasionally carb heavy day isn’t going to impact you negatively. You’ll probably find more benefit in just focusing on a very low carb diet generally with the occasional freedom to eat a bowl of pasta or pizza. \n\nThat’s what I did and the benefits were great. The only side effect is you will likely feel those carbs as heavy and may feel bloated for a couple days.\n\nRefeeds are important. Honestly. If you are fit and have been keto, it might not even kick you out of ketosis. Those carbs are going mostly straight to your muscle  and liver glycogen reserves. If anything, you’ll have a better work out tomorrow.  You can do some research on carb cycling.\n\nNot harmful only thing it will do is kick you off ketosis if you go past 80g of carbs. If your goal is to stay In ketosis just gotta cut back again you’ll be back In a few days.\n\nStill people doing this fad diet in 2025?\n\nI used to do a treat day every 2 weeks.\n\n#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  \n\nDiscussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than \"cuz I sed\" or entertainment pieces.

Consumption of protein at 2 g per kg BW per day is safe for healthy adults, and the tolerable upper limit is 3.5 g per kg BW per day for well-adapted subjects.

      "Look, almost no one in the United States is protein deficient. We all get way more than enough. \n\nThe way they set the USDA minimum is interesting and makes sense. They measured nitrogen use in a sealed lab and set the minimum 2 standard deviations above. And that is .8 grams per kilo. O.8g/kg is the scientifically proven minimum.\n\nIf you are active or chasing an aesthetic, the demand can be higher, but it’s not necessary to eat as high as the gym bros. Above a certain level and if your carbs are low or operating at maintenance calories, your body will potentially just de-amine it via gluconeogenesis and turn it to glucose.  And honestly, you can only get to gym bro level via supplementation. And I define eating extra servings of chicken breast and egg whites as supplementation. \n\nYou can eat more than the USDA minimum, but not much of it is going to end up as extra muscle. It’s also unclear to me if you need to eat more protein only in response to stimulus — ie exercise.  \n\nI personally target 100 grams a day. I weigh 80kg. So I’m above. I’ve played around with higher 1g/1lb of lean body mass. It didn’t make a difference. But I’m pretty active so I’m using 100 grams because it’s easy and will support any additional tissue maintenance from my high activity level. A little under or over I don’t care. And if I have a crazy workout, I’ll eat a steak for dinner and I’ll be way above that 100 number. Timing matters too. I try to give my body what it needs when it needs it. \n\nJust eat some meat or fish regularly, have some eggs and cheese, and eat beans and lentils and you will be fine.

The question of “how much protein does someone actually need?” really depends on the person in question (physical attributes, activities, etc) as well as the true crux of the question- need for what?",
      "Personally I’d say don’t go off of hard limits like that, everyone’s body and lives are different (like someone who uses more muscle ofc will need more protein, and someone who doesn’t need extra muscle will be fine with less) so I believe it’s best to base it around your lifestyle and personal needs/goals",
      "it depends on the age of the person and his/her physical activity",

O.8g/kg is the scientifically proven minimum.\n\nIf you are active or chasing an aesthetic, the demand can be higher, but it’s not necessary to eat as high as the gym bros. Above a certain level and if your carbs are low or operating at maintenance calories, your body will potentially just de-amine it via gluconeogenesis and turn it to glucose.  And honestly, you can only get to gym bro level via supplementation. And I define eating extra servings of chicken breast and egg whites as supplementation. \n\nYou can eat more than the USDA minimum, but not much of it is going to end up as extra muscle. It’s also unclear to me if you need to eat more protein only in response to stimulus — ie exercise.  \n\nI personally target 100 grams a day. I weigh 80kg. So I’m above. I’ve played around with higher 1g/1lb of lean body mass. It didn’t make a difference. But I’m pretty active so I’m using 100 grams because it’s easy and will support any additional tissue maintenance from my high activity level. A little under or over I don’t care. And if I have a crazy workout, I’ll eat a steak for dinner and I’ll be way above that 100 number. Timing matters too. I try to give my body what it needs when it needs it. \n\nJust eat some meat or fish regularly, have some eggs and cheese, and eat beans and lentils and you will be fine. If you are chasing an aesthetic, bump it up, but keep in mind that those protein levels and aesthetics aren’t natural.\n\nI am also very confused because some guys say you don't have to take all of your bodyweight as there is some fat too you have to cut some weight from your body and then calculate it.\n\nNeed for what? Avoiding deficiencies, good health, adding lean mass? Nobody knowledgeable will say you need 1.8-2.2g/kg for survival, but you can absolutely benefit from such intakes. Be mindful that necessary and beneficial aren’t synonyms. Moreover many things (such as your question) are conditional and require context to answer. The question of “how much protein does someone actually need?” really depends on the person in question (physical attributes, activities, etc) as well as the true crux of the question- need for what?\n\nPersonally I’d say don’t go off of hard limits like that, everyone’s body and lives are different (like someone who uses more muscle ofc will need more protein, and someone who doesn’t need extra muscle will be fine with less) so I believe it’s best to base it around your lifestyle and personal needs/goals\n\nit depends on the age of the person and his/her physical activity\n\nThe amount you need vs what's optimal are different. I think 2.2 is more than you need to put on muscle but people like to aim for it, and the extra protein will help but is not needed. 1.5 is more realistic and achievable probably\n\n.8g per kg of bodyweight."

The idea was to try to figure out which foods gave people the most sustained feeling of satiety per calorie, and their study included 38 common foods. I find the recommendations personally useful but, since the original list is pretty limited, it’s surprising that it doesn’t seem like their methodology for finding satiety indices has ever been extended to more foods nor have I seen replications. This seems like a really useful tool for weight loss, and the methodology makes it sound pretty simple to perform. It also had some counter-intuitive results like boiled potatoes being by far most satiating foods despite a lot of modern diet advice focusing on protein and fiber for fullness, which I think would be worth exploring further.\n\nIs there a reason nothing else was done with the satiety index concept or are there other more recent papers I’m missing? \n\nComments:\nhonestly, this is a really great question, and something I’ve questioned as well.\n\nOne thing I have noticed with working across hundreds of clients, is that some people find the satiety value of things like oatmeal very different (rated as fairly high satiety in this paper).

You can look at the day as a whole\n\nWhile collagen has various potential benefits, it's a terrible P source. Mix it with something like whey or other high quality source.\n\nNo. And collagen does nothing for “muscle building”. It helps tendon, ligament, joint repair/recovery\n\nMost protein researchers recommend to not even count collagen toward your daily protein intake, just take 15-30g and move on"

A lot of sea salt on the food. \n\nI just find that I run really well off fat and don’t get hungry, but I perform better for some activities if I top off glycogen the night before.\n\nyour biggest ROI / big rocks when it comes to nutrient trimming:\n\n1) getting 3 meal in per day each with a solid bolus of protein (diminishing returns on muscle protein synthesis with further bolus)\n\n2) especially for females, not training fasted (regardless of goals). but if your goal specifically is  hypertrophy, then you shouldn’t be training fasted regardless.\n\nafter that, ensuring you’re eating within the peri- workout window, in the 5 hours around your workout, including workout time, is ideal.\n\nNot important is my take \n\nI do IF 20:4 and have lost 90 lbs and kept it off for 10 years\n\n#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  \n\nDiscussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than \"cuz I sed\" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.\n\n**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  \n\n**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  \n\n**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy\n\n*Please vote accordingly and report any uglies*\n\n---\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/nutrition) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nIt can differ between people, but only in terms of preference for the most part.\n\nFor myself, I perform best when I have quick carbs and protein before a workout - I feel more energized and sustained during things like long runs especially. My wife on the other hand, needs to have a buffer between her intake and exercise.\n\nOlder studies did suggest the benefit of an anabolic window. However, more recent studies and meta analyses debunked that. Nutrient timing is insignificant when controlled for proper daily macro intake; some studies suggest an exception to this may be in elderly people, which may be age-related protein synthesis efficiency rather than other factors. \n\nAnother exception is higher intensity and/or endurance exercise - studies suggest this is when protein and carb timing can make a notable difference for performance, energy and recovery.\n\nAnecdotally, I’m a cardio queen and love running. I *need* quick carbs before run days. Steel cut oats are for lifting days, toast is for running days. \n\nAs for the rest of the day/macros? Honestly I don’t know, but everyone is busy so I personally have adopted the “everything worth doing is worth half assing” mentality\n\nA little important if you have goals and want to perform the best\n\nIncreased performance = Increased results\n\nBut you can put it on the back burner. Preworkout nutrition is more important that post workout. Post workout can just be a normal meal"
