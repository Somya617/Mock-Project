    "combined_text": "Title: It's not just about calories\n\nPost: I've noticed that in many nutrition discussions, people focus on macronutrients and calories, but far less attention is given to how well those nutrients are absorbed. Two people can eat exactly the same foods yet have completely different outcomes in terms of energy, digestion, or body composition.\n\nI started working with JM Nutrition, a group of registered nutritionists here in Canada, to understand why, in my case, certain meal plans didn't produce the same results I saw in others. It was eye-opening to discover that factors like digestive health, food combinations, stress levels, and even medical history can greatly influence how the body processes and utilizes nutrients.\n\nOne concrete example I experienced was with protein intake. After making a few diet adjustments recommended by them, my digestion and muscle recovery improved noticeably, even though the total amount of protein stayed the same. The difference came from how I combined the foods and the timing of when I consumed them.\n\nI think it's worth paying more attention not just to what we eat, but also to how and how well the body uses it.\n\nComments:\nIf you control for LBM, bodyfat %, and activity, the differences are negligible\n\nOp: it's not just about calories\n\nAlso Op: it's all about calories (but he doesn't realize it yet so takes the long way)\n\nI regret to inform you if you're trying to lose or gain weight, it is all about calories, everything else is cope.

I’ve been working 8ish hour shifts where I have very little ability to bring food that needs refrigerated / reheat food. There’s vending machines and a cafeteria but I don’t have access to the cafeteria every day and don’t want to waste my money when I do and also don’t want to waste my money on super unhealthy vending machine snacks. \n\nDoes anyone have any creative ideas on alternative snacks to bring to work? I had been bringing some kind of  protein bar + a healthier snack each day but it’s really been messing with my digestive system. This week I’ve brought a peanut butter jelly apple sandwiches + a piece of fruit and this has been a lot better, but does anyone have any suggestions for alternatives that would be fine in my backpack (and possibly the heat) for a few hours? It’s a very physically job and I don’t have the time or ability to really eat a full meal but I need a few things to keep my energy up throughout the shift. \n\nI was thinking about making some oat pancakes to switch it up, but would these be all right after sitting out for a few hours?

    "combined_text": "Title: How Does Protein Effect a Wourkout Time-wise?\n\nPost: I will preface this by saying that I understand that a constant good diet and constant workout/exercise is best. I am asking just to better understand how the protein helps.\n\nIf I were to work out one time, and have only one day that i have a high protein meal, would it be best to have that meal the night before a workout, the day of the workout, or the day after the workout? So im asking if its the protein already in your system (day before), or the protein that's starting digestion (day of), or the protein while sore and in recovery (day after), that has the largest effect on muscle growth? \n\nAgain, im asking solely to understand how protein actually affects muscle growth, not looking to only eat protein once every 3 days or looking for diet advice, thanks!\n\nComments:\nBarely matters at all as long as you supply your body with enough of all the amino acids it needs. The most important factor that determines the hypertrophy you're going to get is whether or not your workout created the molecular signal to trigger hypertrophy, and that's going to be much more dependant on your glycogen status (how depleted or glycogen loaded you are), which is going to impact your performance and thus the hypertrophy stimulus you can generate, and your carbohydrate intake is going to determine this (obviously depends on a variety of other factors not related to diet). If you create the stimulus and the protein is there, the fibers must and will grow\n\nProtein timing has a teeny tiny impact on growth, it's mostly marketing and nerd min/maxing.\n\nIf you can have a shake post work out, do it.\n\nIf not, it's not worth changing your day to make it happen.\n\nSo it’s very complicated and it’s impossible to say exactly what’s happening, but probably easiest to think of it this way:\n\nThe total amount of protein per day you have is your stored protein.

    "combined_text": "Title: Why are beans and legumes so inconsistent in nutritional value across different brands?\n\nPost: Has anyone else noticed that there is no consistency in the nutritional values of beans? As an example, I have Thrive Market dried red lentils, which have 100 calories, 9g protein, and 8g fiber per serving. That's 1g protein per every ~11 calories. But then a bag of Goya dried red lentils is 160 calories, 11g protein, 5g fiber. Lower fiber and 1g of protein per every ~14 calories. \n\nNot just lentils either. I have Iberia red kidney beans, which are 70 calories, 9g protein, 14g fiber per serving (1g protein per 8 calories). Goya's label for the same beans says 140 calories, 9g protein, 6g fiber (1g protein per 16 calories). Way less protein and fiber than Iberia. \n\nAnd this is across so many other brands too, different for every brand, different for canned vs. dried. What's the deal??\n\nI'd like to point out that I know the serving sizes vary across each product, but that doesn't explain why the calorie to protein and calorie to fiber ratio is so different. \n\nComments:\nBasically, it's because the FDA allows a certain amount of rounding.

      "When eaten as part of a mixed meal, the glycemic impact is often reduced. Rice is usually eaten as part of a whole meal with fats, proteins, and fiber from other foods. \n\nIt's also a different kind of sugar. Rice has glucose, which enters the bloodstream right away and is regulated by the liver. Sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose. Fructose goes straight to the liver. It bypasses some of the control steps that glucose has, so large amounts can lead to increased fat production in the liver.",
      "White rice isn’t a nutrient dense food, but it does have other nutrients like protein and a small amount of fiber.  It in has all 9 essential amino acids, but only very low amounts of Lysine, luckily, legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc) are a high protein food with a high amount of lysine but low in methionine.  Rice happens to have a high amount of. Which is why you often hear beans and rice form a complete protein. Individually neither rice nor legumes are a complete protein, but together they are. While sugar contains no protein/amino acids. \n\nBut to answer your question, functionally, eating rice is not the same as eating sugar. For starters, sugar is more than three times more calorically dense than rice. You have to eat more than 300g of rice to reach the same amount of carbohydrates as 100g of sugar. The volume makes a difference in satiation. 100g of sugar will give you the calories, but will not signal to your brain you’re full, so you continue feel hungry and crave more food. Rice is also a neutral food, which means it can be eaten with other food, to make it more filling. \n\nAdditionally, consider the starch in rice transforms into resistant starch once cooked, cooled and reheated, and act more like fiber than starch during the digestive process, which not only triggers a lower glycemic response, it’s is also beneficial to your gut microbiome.\n\nSo while you can get the same values of carbohydrate from rice and sugar, rice is more versatile and more nutritious when eaten with other foods, because it complements the nutritional profiles of especially other plant based protein sources.",
      "Why health-conscious people avoid processed sugar but not white rice:\n\nWhite rice (despite being a high-glycemic carb) is often paired with nutrient-dense foods (vegetables, proteins, fats) in balanced meals, slowing digestion and glycemic impact. \n\nProcessed sugar is typically consumed in isolation (soda, candy) or in nutrient-poor foods, which spikes blood sugar rapidly.\n\nIf you look into cultural dietary patterns, rice-based cultures (e.g., Asian) often have balanced diets w/ vegetables, lean proteins, and lower processed food intake, unlike sugar-heavy Western diets.",
      "Fructose. It is all fructose. Your body has limited ability to clear fructose. Sugar has a fructose and a glucose molecule. The fructose is the bad guy if your body has too much. It must be processed in the liver, unlike glucose.",
      "Rice fills glycogen stores and [glycogen] carbs are beneficial for performance and hypertrophy \n\nSugar contains fructose which is metabolized in the liver and has less beneficial properties than glycogen, but it still helps fill liver glycogen which is beneficial for endurance athletes \n\nBlood sugar spikes are not unhealthy, and are actually beneficial for “shuttling” nutrients. \n\nThis sub is is filled with people that focus on eating for “longevity” and not athletic performance, so a lot of comments you read are from people that have no idea what they’re talking about and demonize certain foods. There are no bad carbohydrates, just mistimed applications \n\nSimple carbs are usually preferred sources from athletes because they are easier to digest, which doesn’t interfere with workouts (stomach issues)",
      "White rice has much more than just carbs unlike white sugar.  \nBut yeah, white rice is still vastly nutritionally inferior to whole.  \n\nAn unsaid benefit of white rice is it is low in fiber so it is interesting when you don't want GI troubles during a long race for example. It is superior for carbs loading than pasta.",
      "I'd argue that when you eat white rice, you must chew that food which causes neurological signals from the masseters to signal food being eaten so you cant eat as much rice as you can sugar. Also, amylase is being released when you eat rice which may also have a rate limiting effect.\n\n\nThe simplest answer though is the more isolated and refined a macro is (and this goes for whey isolate too) the completely different effect it will have on the body than the initial food in complete form would, even if it too is high in the macro being consumed.",
      "I’m confused as to why you don’t think rice has micro-nutrients.  Please look that up, it absolutely has fiber, protein, vitamins & minerals.",

    "combined_text": "Title: Confused about Rice vs Processed sugar\n\nPost: If white rice and processed sugar are both high glycemic carbs with little to no micro nutrients why do people who are into health and fitness often avoid one and praise the other? \n\nIs the fact that white rice is complex carb matter if it's still high glycemic \n\nWhy are cultures who's diet is mainly white rice seem so much healthier than cultures and countries who's diets are high in sugar, is it correlation or causation?\n\nIf an athlete who eats white rice with most meals replaces his rice with an equivalents amount (in terms of macros) sugar water and drinks it together with his fats and proteins, would his performance stay the same or go down?\n\nDo we have long term studies comparing a high rice vs high sugar diet that take into account the rest of the persons diet? To figure out the correlation vs causation issue from earlier \n\nIf a person cuts out all refined sugar but continues eating rice with most meals would there still be positive effects?\n\n\n\nComments:\nWhen eaten as part of a mixed meal, the glycemic impact is often reduced. Rice is usually eaten as part of a whole meal with fats, proteins, and fiber from other foods. \n\nIt's also a different kind of sugar. Rice has glucose, which enters the bloodstream right away and is regulated by the liver. Sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose. Fructose goes straight to the liver. It bypasses some of the control steps that glucose has, so large amounts can lead to increased fat production in the liver.\n\nWhite rice isn’t a nutrient dense food, but it does have other nutrients like protein and a small amount of fiber.  It in has all 9 essential amino acids, but only very low amounts of Lysine, luckily, legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc) are a high protein food with a high amount of lysine but low in methionine.  Rice happens to have a high amount of. Which is why you often hear beans and rice form a complete protein. Individually neither rice nor legumes are a complete protein, but together they are. While sugar contains no protein/amino acids. \n\nBut to answer your question, functionally, eating rice is not the same as eating sugar. For starters, sugar is more than three times more calorically dense than rice. You have to eat more than 300g of rice to reach the same amount of carbohydrates as 100g of sugar. The volume makes a difference in satiation. 100g of sugar will give you the calories, but will not signal to your brain you’re full, so you continue feel hungry and crave more food. Rice is also a neutral food, which means it can be eaten with other food, to make it more filling. \n\nAdditionally, consider the starch in rice transforms into resistant starch once cooked, cooled and reheated, and act more like fiber than starch during the digestive process, which not only triggers a lower glycemic response, it’s is also beneficial to your gut microbiome.\n\nSo while you can get the same values of carbohydrate from rice and sugar, rice is more versatile and more nutritious when eaten with other foods, because it complements the nutritional profiles of especially other plant based protein sources.\n\nWhy health-conscious people avoid processed sugar but not white rice:\n\nWhite rice (despite being a high-glycemic carb) is often paired with nutrient-dense foods (vegetables, proteins, fats) in balanced meals, slowing digestion and glycemic impact. \n\nProcessed sugar is typically consumed in isolation (soda, candy) or in nutrient-poor foods, which spikes blood sugar rapidly.\n\nIf you look into cultural dietary patterns, rice-based cultures (e.g., Asian) often have balanced diets w/ vegetables, lean proteins, and lower processed food intake, unlike sugar-heavy Western diets.\n\nFructose. It is all fructose. Your body has limited ability to clear fructose. Sugar has a fructose and a glucose molecule. The fructose is the bad guy if your body has too much. It must be processed in the liver, unlike glucose.\n\nRice fills glycogen stores and [glycogen] carbs are beneficial for performance and hypertrophy \n\nSugar contains fructose which is metabolized in the liver and has less beneficial properties than glycogen, but it still helps fill liver glycogen which is beneficial for endurance athletes \n\nBlood sugar spikes are not unhealthy, and are actually beneficial for “shuttling” nutrients. \n\nThis sub is is filled with people that focus on eating for “longevity” and not athletic performance, so a lot of comments you read are from people that have no idea what they’re talking about and demonize certain foods. There are no bad carbohydrates, just mistimed applications \n\nSimple carbs are usually preferred sources from athletes because they are easier to digest, which doesn’t interfere with workouts (stomach issues)\n\nWhite rice has much more than just carbs unlike white sugar.  \nBut yeah, white rice is still vastly nutritionally inferior to whole.  \n\nAn unsaid benefit of white rice is it is low in fiber so it is interesting when you don't want GI troubles during a long race for example. It is superior for carbs loading than pasta.\n\nI'd argue that when you eat white rice, you must chew that food which causes neurological signals from the masseters to signal food being eaten so you cant eat as much rice as you can sugar. Also, amylase is being released when you eat rice which may also have a rate limiting effect.\n\n\nThe simplest answer though is the more isolated and refined a macro is (and this goes for whey isolate too) the completely different effect it will have on the body than the initial food in complete form would, even if it too is high in the macro being consumed.\n\nI’m confused as to why you don’t think rice has micro-nutrients.  Please look that up, it absolutely has fiber, protein, vitamins & minerals.\n\nOmg.. whole food is always better for you than ultra-processed food. It's just better, and it's especially true for Carbs being a human body's main/favoured fuel source; The body gets addicted. Even pure fruit juice is liquid sugar and should be consumed strategically(before exercise), not mindlessly..\n\nThe amount of people on this sub trying to wiggle around, overthink it, use technicalities to defend processed sugars.. the paranoid part of me is thinking it's like their bots working for big business sugar, spreading misinformation on purpose- \"it's the same\", \"calories in calories out\" \"it's all technically carbohydrates, soo......\"\n\nI gotta block this sub.

      "Why are you eating keto in the first place? If you are a healthy weight, what is the benefit? Just eat a moderate diet.",
      "“Cheating” on keto will result in leaving ketosis (burning fat instead of glucose for energy), so yeah if you’re trying to eat keto it isn’t the best choice. \nThat said, eating keto is far from healthy by itself. The only benefit is to cut calories by eliminating carbs as an option and thereby create a caloric deficit to lose weight. It’s a short term strategy useful because the downsides of being overweight are worse overall. In the long term, eating keto inevitably results in overconsumption of saturated fat, which increases risk of atherosclerosis. Keep eating a high fat diet after you reach a healthy weight, and all you’ll do is get high blood pressure and clogged arteries.\nIt’s healthier to eat plenty of carbs from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains as well as lean sources of protein, while keeping your calories at maintenance levels.",
      "If you’re not too worried about glucose levels and staying in ketosis, the occasionally carb heavy day isn’t going to impact you negatively. You’ll probably find more benefit in just focusing on a very low carb diet generally with the occasional freedom to eat a bowl of pasta or pizza. \n\nThat’s what I did and the benefits were great. The only side effect is you will likely feel those carbs as heavy and may feel bloated for a couple days.",
      "Refeeds are important. Honestly. If you are fit and have been keto, it might not even kick you out of ketosis. Those carbs are going mostly straight to your muscle  and liver glycogen reserves. If anything, you’ll have a better work out tomorrow.  You can do some research on carb cycling.",
      "Not harmful only thing it will do is kick you off ketosis if you go past 80g of carbs. If your goal is to stay In ketosis just gotta cut back again you’ll be back In a few days.",

    "combined_text": "Title: I’ve been eating Keto meals for the past 2-3 weeks and I’m about to have a cheat meal.\n\nPost: For reference, I’m a 31 yo male who’s in shape. I regularly go to the gym and lift weights/kettle bell workouts. In the past I’ve eaten out a lot and would eat a lot of high carb meals, my metabolism is pretty fast so I’ve never gained too much weight. \n\nI’ve gotten a lot leaner on keto and have felt great. I’ve been invited to a meal tonight of fried calamari and French fries. \n\nThis motivated me to do some more research on keto and I’m reading that it can be really bad to have cheat meals. I don’t NEED to do keto since I’m generally pretty healthy, but I do like the benefits. As well as the creative meals, like pork grind and cream cheese/shredded cheese crust pizza.  \n\nMy question is - is it harmful to eat Keto meals while also consuming regular meals every now and then? Like protein pasta one night, then a keto pizza the next?\n\nComments:\nThe term *cheat meal* needs to get out of society’s vocabulary. How’s your cholesterol?\n\nWhy are you eating keto in the first place? If you are a healthy weight, what is the benefit? Just eat a moderate diet.\n\n“Cheating” on keto will result in leaving ketosis (burning fat instead of glucose for energy), so yeah if you’re trying to eat keto it isn’t the best choice. \nThat said, eating keto is far from healthy by itself. The only benefit is to cut calories by eliminating carbs as an option and thereby create a caloric deficit to lose weight. It’s a short term strategy useful because the downsides of being overweight are worse overall. In the long term, eating keto inevitably results in overconsumption of saturated fat, which increases risk of atherosclerosis. Keep eating a high fat diet after you reach a healthy weight, and all you’ll do is get high blood pressure and clogged arteries.\nIt’s healthier to eat plenty of carbs from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains as well as lean sources of protein, while keeping your calories at maintenance levels.\n\nIf you’re not too worried about glucose levels and staying in ketosis, the occasionally carb heavy day isn’t going to impact you negatively. You’ll probably find more benefit in just focusing on a very low carb diet generally with the occasional freedom to eat a bowl of pasta or pizza. \n\nThat’s what I did and the benefits were great. The only side effect is you will likely feel those carbs as heavy and may feel bloated for a couple days.\n\nRefeeds are important. Honestly. If you are fit and have been keto, it might not even kick you out of ketosis. Those carbs are going mostly straight to your muscle  and liver glycogen reserves. If anything, you’ll have a better work out tomorrow.  You can do some research on carb cycling.\n\nNot harmful only thing it will do is kick you off ketosis if you go past 80g of carbs. If your goal is to stay In ketosis just gotta cut back again you’ll be back In a few days.\n\nStill people doing this fad diet in 2025?\n\nI used to do a treat day every 2 weeks.\n\n#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  \n\nDiscussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than \"cuz I sed\" or entertainment pieces.

Consumption of protein at 2 g per kg BW per day is safe for healthy adults, and the tolerable upper limit is 3.5 g per kg BW per day for well-adapted subjects.

      "Look, almost no one in the United States is protein deficient. We all get way more than enough. \n\nThe way they set the USDA minimum is interesting and makes sense. They measured nitrogen use in a sealed lab and set the minimum 2 standard deviations above. And that is .8 grams per kilo. O.8g/kg is the scientifically proven minimum.\n\nIf you are active or chasing an aesthetic, the demand can be higher, but it’s not necessary to eat as high as the gym bros. Above a certain level and if your carbs are low or operating at maintenance calories, your body will potentially just de-amine it via gluconeogenesis and turn it to glucose.  And honestly, you can only get to gym bro level via supplementation. And I define eating extra servings of chicken breast and egg whites as supplementation. \n\nYou can eat more than the USDA minimum, but not much of it is going to end up as extra muscle. It’s also unclear to me if you need to eat more protein only in response to stimulus — ie exercise.  \n\nI personally target 100 grams a day. I weigh 80kg. So I’m above. I’ve played around with higher 1g/1lb of lean body mass. It didn’t make a difference. But I’m pretty active so I’m using 100 grams because it’s easy and will support any additional tissue maintenance from my high activity level. A little under or over I don’t care. And if I have a crazy workout, I’ll eat a steak for dinner and I’ll be way above that 100 number. Timing matters too. I try to give my body what it needs when it needs it. \n\nJust eat some meat or fish regularly, have some eggs and cheese, and eat beans and lentils and you will be fine.

The question of “how much protein does someone actually need?” really depends on the person in question (physical attributes, activities, etc) as well as the true crux of the question- need for what?",
      "Personally I’d say don’t go off of hard limits like that, everyone’s body and lives are different (like someone who uses more muscle ofc will need more protein, and someone who doesn’t need extra muscle will be fine with less) so I believe it’s best to base it around your lifestyle and personal needs/goals",
      "it depends on the age of the person and his/her physical activity",

O.8g/kg is the scientifically proven minimum.\n\nIf you are active or chasing an aesthetic, the demand can be higher, but it’s not necessary to eat as high as the gym bros. Above a certain level and if your carbs are low or operating at maintenance calories, your body will potentially just de-amine it via gluconeogenesis and turn it to glucose.  And honestly, you can only get to gym bro level via supplementation. And I define eating extra servings of chicken breast and egg whites as supplementation. \n\nYou can eat more than the USDA minimum, but not much of it is going to end up as extra muscle. It’s also unclear to me if you need to eat more protein only in response to stimulus — ie exercise.  \n\nI personally target 100 grams a day. I weigh 80kg. So I’m above. I’ve played around with higher 1g/1lb of lean body mass. It didn’t make a difference. But I’m pretty active so I’m using 100 grams because it’s easy and will support any additional tissue maintenance from my high activity level. A little under or over I don’t care. And if I have a crazy workout, I’ll eat a steak for dinner and I’ll be way above that 100 number. Timing matters too. I try to give my body what it needs when it needs it. \n\nJust eat some meat or fish regularly, have some eggs and cheese, and eat beans and lentils and you will be fine. If you are chasing an aesthetic, bump it up, but keep in mind that those protein levels and aesthetics aren’t natural.\n\nI am also very confused because some guys say you don't have to take all of your bodyweight as there is some fat too you have to cut some weight from your body and then calculate it.\n\nNeed for what? Avoiding deficiencies, good health, adding lean mass? Nobody knowledgeable will say you need 1.8-2.2g/kg for survival, but you can absolutely benefit from such intakes. Be mindful that necessary and beneficial aren’t synonyms. Moreover many things (such as your question) are conditional and require context to answer. The question of “how much protein does someone actually need?” really depends on the person in question (physical attributes, activities, etc) as well as the true crux of the question- need for what?\n\nPersonally I’d say don’t go off of hard limits like that, everyone’s body and lives are different (like someone who uses more muscle ofc will need more protein, and someone who doesn’t need extra muscle will be fine with less) so I believe it’s best to base it around your lifestyle and personal needs/goals\n\nit depends on the age of the person and his/her physical activity\n\nThe amount you need vs what's optimal are different. I think 2.2 is more than you need to put on muscle but people like to aim for it, and the extra protein will help but is not needed. 1.5 is more realistic and achievable probably\n\n.8g per kg of bodyweight."

The idea was to try to figure out which foods gave people the most sustained feeling of satiety per calorie, and their study included 38 common foods. I find the recommendations personally useful but, since the original list is pretty limited, it’s surprising that it doesn’t seem like their methodology for finding satiety indices has ever been extended to more foods nor have I seen replications. This seems like a really useful tool for weight loss, and the methodology makes it sound pretty simple to perform. It also had some counter-intuitive results like boiled potatoes being by far most satiating foods despite a lot of modern diet advice focusing on protein and fiber for fullness, which I think would be worth exploring further.\n\nIs there a reason nothing else was done with the satiety index concept or are there other more recent papers I’m missing? \n\nComments:\nhonestly, this is a really great question, and something I’ve questioned as well.\n\nOne thing I have noticed with working across hundreds of clients, is that some people find the satiety value of things like oatmeal very different (rated as fairly high satiety in this paper).

You can look at the day as a whole\n\nWhile collagen has various potential benefits, it's a terrible P source. Mix it with something like whey or other high quality source.\n\nNo. And collagen does nothing for “muscle building”. It helps tendon, ligament, joint repair/recovery\n\nMost protein researchers recommend to not even count collagen toward your daily protein intake, just take 15-30g and move on"

However, more recent studies and meta analyses debunked that.

I *need* quick carbs before run days. Steel cut oats are for lifting days, toast is for running days. \n\nAs for the rest of the day/macros?

      "“The calories from protein are derived from its amino acids, which can be used to build muscle, enzymes, and other tissues, effectively “storing” those calories in the chemical bonds of new tissue rather than burning them for immediate energy. However, the process of digesting protein (thermic effect, 20-30% of calories burned) and building tissues (e.g., muscle protein synthesis) consumes additional energy, often drawn from fat stores or other sources in a calorie deficit. Thus, while protein contributes to your total caloric intake, its calories are often partitioned toward structural roles, making it less efficient as an energy source compared to carbs or fats, especially when prioritizing muscle preservation or growth.”\n\n***\n\nSo while protein is 4 calories per gram, after digestion, it’s more around 3 calories per gram",
      "Your TDEE should take that into account via basal metabolic rate / neat + eat (more active people need more calories partly because of the increased muscle protein synthesis).\n\nHowever, there’s an interesting recent study that shows that in resistance trained individuals, significantly overeating protein doesn’t lead to a change in body composition: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5786199/",
      "I don’t think our bodies are systematic like that since protein always comes with fat in nature. How our bodies are is more complicated and interconnected than how we break it down to explain and understand things in isolation or/and categories. \n\nThere are different protein recommendations based on your goals.

The ironic part of this equation is that the body requires energy to catalyze the protein digestion process and that energy must come in from outside the reaction itself, thus why most animal protein is wrapped in fat or other high-energy sourced materials.",
      "Basically, your body uses protein both for energy and for building/repairing tissue. The calories used for building aren’t “lost,” they’re just redirected to muscle and other functions, so you don’t necessarily need extra calories beyond your TDEE. Tracking total calories is usually enough, but thinking about how protein is used can help if you’re focused on maintaining muscle while cutting fat."

(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!\n\nComments:\n#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  \n\nDiscussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than \"cuz I sed\" or entertainment pieces.

      "Yes. 👀⬇️\n\n“As you can see, magnesium oxide contains the most elemental magnesium of 60%. And 23% of this can be absorbed. Magnesium citrate, for example, contains only 11% elemental magnesium. And only 30% of this is absorbed.”\n\nOn the web, you’ll see many sites claiming that only 4% of the magnesium in magnesium oxide is absorbed. This claim is based upon a small study by Firoz et al. (2001), which is discussed fully below. The actual data in this study shows something very different. The stated percentage of elemental magnesium absorbed from magnesium oxide in the above table — 23% — is the statistic provided in a review and meta-analysis of numerous studies by Ranade et al., (2001), cited below.\n\nIn a study involving 18 men, 24 hours after consumption of magnesium oxide supplements, magnesium levels in the urine increased about two times the normal amount. And, after 48 hours, magnesium levels had increased to roughly four times normal. The conclusion drawn by the researchers: these results clearly show that “magnesium oxide is effectively absorbed and elevates the biologically-active levels of magnesium in the bloodstream.”\n\nIn one such study in 2005, rats were first given a magnesium-depleted diet and then provided with the same diet supplemented with 10 different magnesium salts: magnesium oxide, chloride, sulfate, carbonate, acetate, picolate, citrate, gluconate, lactate or aspartate. The results showed that while magnesium absorption values varied from 50% to 67%, all the magnesium salts used were equally efficient in restoring magnesium levels.\n\nThe researchers also noted that “the quantity of magnesium in the digestive tract is the major factor controlling the amount of magnesium absorbed.” And as you now know, magnesium oxide contains a far greater amount of elemental magnesium than any of the other magnesium salts.\n\nThe addition of phytic acid to the animals’ diet is important because phytic acid binds strongly to minerals and forms an insoluble complex. This means less of the minerals consumed can be absorbed. Despite the addition of phytic acid to the animals’ diet, all the magnesium salts tested were found to be comparably bioavailable: “The results indicate that any differences in the magnesium bioavailability of the compounds were small and physiologically irrelevant.”\n\nThe lower parts of the small intestine are the primary sites of magnesium absorption. However, magnesium is also absorbed throughout the entire intestinal tract. Magnesium does not have special carriers that pull it into the bloodstream. Its absorption is a passive transcellular process.\n\nFor this kind of absorption process, the quantity of magnesium that passes through the digestive tract is the major factor controlling the amount of magnesium that is absorbed.\n\nBecause magnesium oxide contains more elemental magnesium and is less soluble, it’s absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly as it passes through the digestive tract. It will not raise blood levels excessively, and will therefore not be rapidly excreted.",

It's also much more expensive. \n\nIf anyone is in the same boat and hasn't tried oxide, it's at least worth a shot.

I'm not sure if you're aware of the % DV reflecting protein adjusted for PDCAAS scores, but I just found out that one of the protein powders I use - sunwarrior brown rice - only lists 16% DV per 20g when it should be 40%?! \n\nPlus warrior blend shows only 25% per 17g protein when it should be 34%?! \n\nThis is the case for many plant proteins !! I've yet to find one that match the actual DV :(\n\nI am very baffled and overthinking - did I waste my money ? SW claims complete proteins, but it is not reflected in the DV ?\n\nI thought I'd been getting 90-100g protein per day, but it might be 60-70g in actuality ? \n\nMakes sense given my serum protein markers have been falling lately, ever since I switched to SW brown rice from pea (in an attempt to reduce iron - I have high ferritin) :(. \n\nDo you guys track these?

I didn’t expect much — maybe slightly better sleep or something like that. I have tried multi vitamins, and several fitness supplements, and 99% of the time I don’t really feel any difference, and have thought most supplements to be a waste of money and time.\n\nAnyone have better experience with specific supplement brands, or specific magnesium types?\n\nHere is what I experienced:\n\nOn the positive side\n\n* Woke up feeling… clearer in the morning (perhaps due to better sleep)\n* Felt calmer during day and evening, not wired like usual after work.\n* Sneaky bonus: fewer tension headaches (not a miracle—but noticeable, been having regular migraines for past 10 years, so any period without is amazing)\n\nNegative side:\n\n* Stomach cramps in the morning 3 of the days in the week I tried it. Don’t know if it has been due to the magnesium tablets I bought.\n\nThe supplement I tried: easy to find, inexpensive, and backed by some interesting studies on stress, sleep, and nervous system support.\n\nCurious—has anyone else tried magnesium? What form did you use, and what did it do for you? Would love honest experiences 🤔\n\nAs something new, I am trying to share my experiences with everything I try on YouTube, as perhaps a better format than articles. I am not very good at it, but perhaps its a good way to communicate stuff like this.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdFNQ6dQ2wU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdFNQ6dQ2wU)\n\n\n\nComments:\nI find it really really hard to get up in the morning after taking magnesium.\n\nYou took the wrong magnesium for sleep.

I already aim to lift heavy, but am going to switch to 3 full body workouts instead of 5 split body workouts. I’d like to add SIT and JT on my off days, looking for ideas of how others do that. I prefer to workout at home, and have access to a treadmill, rower, kettlebells, and smart gym.\n\nFor SIT (sprint interval training: 20-30s of 100% effort followed by complete recovery), I’m struggling a bit with going all out and getting my heart rate up in a short period of time with bodyweight activities. I am not a great runner, very heavy on my feet, and also don’t cycle - those are the two obvious choices for SIT, so wondering how else I can approach it.\n\nFor JT (jump training), are jumping jacks, jump rope, etc. enough, or should I try more jumps with more force/impact?\n\nI’ve read Next Level, but there just wasn’t enough detail for me to get a good idea of how to structure these workouts. Would love to hear how others incorporate these things!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/xxfitness) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nI do SIT on the elliptical on highest resistance for the 30 seconds, my Heartrate goes up to 90% after around 20s, and I get around 6 high intensity spikes in the 30 mins. For jump training, which I haven't started yet, she suggests jump squats or jumping onto and off a low bench or whatever. She mentioned jumping Jacks as well, not sure about the rope."

The manufacturer advertises advantages including being free from band substances, antibiotic free, and of course zero grams of sugar. \n\nLooking at the ingredient list it has whey protein isolate for 90% of the product. The non-medicinal ingredients includes stevia, sucralose and then natural and artificial flavors including maltodextrin, citric acid and sodium citrate. \n\nApparently, maltodextrin can Spike blood sugar and also irritate the gut, potentially impacting permeability.

      "Creatine is always an easy place to see quick wins! \n\nBut i also ran this question through OpenHealth because I was curious and got this response. \n\n**OpenHealth excerpt:** \n\nFor your goal of rebuilding strength and muscle after a period of muscle wasting, especially with a sensitive stomach, starting with a high-quality whey protein isolate is the most effective and gentle option. It provides the essential building blocks your body needs for muscle repair and is typically the easiest of the three to digest.\n\n**Key Points**\n\nWhey Protein is Foundational: It directly supplies the amino acids necessary for muscle protein synthesis, making it the most fundamental supplement for recovery and rebuilding tissue after muscle loss \\[1\\]. A whey isolate or hydrolysate form is best for sensitive stomachs as it contains minimal lactose.\n\nCreatine Boosts Performance: Creatine works by increasing your muscles' energy supply, which helps improve strength and performance during physical activity. It helps you do the work that builds muscle but does not provide the building blocks itself. It can sometimes cause gastrointestinal upset, especially initially.\n\nHMB Prevents Breakdown: Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that primarily works by reducing muscle protein breakdown. It is most effective in clinical situations involving significant muscle wasting, such as recovery from illness or injury, but its added benefit is less clear when protein intake is already sufficient \\[2\\].\n\nGut Tolerance is Key: Given your sensitive gut, whey protein isolate is the safest starting choice because it's filtered to remove most of the lactose and fat that can cause digestive issues. Creatine can cause bloating or stomach discomfort in some individuals, while HMB is generally well-tolerated but less critical than adequate protein intake.\n\nDiet and Activity First: No supplement can replace a foundation of adequate nutrition and gentle, progressive physical activity. The supplement is meant to support your recovery, not drive it entirely.\n\nMedical Consultation is Essential: Because your muscle wasting is linked to a health issue, it is crucial to discuss any new supplement with your healthcare provider to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your specific condition.\n\n**Action Items**\n\nConsult Your Healthcare Provider: Before starting any supplement, discuss your plan with your doctor or a registered dietitian. They can provide guidance based on your medical history and ensure there are no contraindications.\n\nPrioritize Whole-Food Nutrition: Focus on meeting your protein needs through your diet first. Aim for sources like lean chicken, fish, eggs, and legumes before relying on a supplement.\n\nChoose Whey Protein Isolate or Hydrolysate: If you proceed with a supplement, select a whey protein isolate or hydrolysate. These forms are purer and contain very little lactose, making them much easier on the digestive system than whey concentrate.\n\nStart with a Half Dose: To assess your tolerance, begin with half a scoop mixed with water or a milk alternative. If you tolerate it well for a few days, you can gradually increase to a full serving.\n\nTime it Around Light Activity: Consume your protein shake after gentle activity, such as a walk or physical therapy exercises, to provide your muscles with the resources they need for recovery.\n\nStay Well-Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Proper hydration is essential for both muscle function and digestive health, and it can help mitigate potential side effects from supplements.\n\nMonitor Your Symptoms: Pay close attention to any digestive discomfort, such as bloating, gas, or stomach pain. If symptoms occur, discontinue use and consult your healthcare provider.",

Where should I start?\n\nPost: I am looking to build some strength and muscle back after a long stretch of an health issue that has caused muscle wasting. Not looking to lift heavy or build huge muscle or even go to the GYM yet, just to get back to a strength level for easy day to day activity. I want to start with only 1 supplement and have received many recommendations. \n\nWhich of the three is better to start? Creatine, Whey Protein with amino acids or HMB?

Any protein powder that contains chocolate will also test higher for heavy metals.\n\nRules of r/supplements \n\n1.\nDo Not Suggest Prescription Drugs\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Do Not Suggest Prescription Drugs\nPrescription drugs are not Supplements; do not recommend prescription medication. \nSensible/Suggest talking to DR. can be allowable etc\n                  \n\n2.\nDangerous Grey Area Substance\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Dangerous Grey Area Substance\nPotentially dangerous grey area substances can not be recommended.\n\n\n3.\nBe Polite\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Rude/Personal Attacks\nYou shouldn't ever be personally attacking another user in this subreddit.\n\n\n4.\nNo Advertisements\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Advertisement.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Supplements) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nIt's difficult for anyone to know whether you will react to any particular protein source. I have tried a number of vegan proteins. \n\nPea protein which I liked the texture and other things could make it taste better such as culinary herbs.\n\nRice protein which I disliked because it was so finely powdered that it went everywhere and was very difficult to mix.\n\nSoy/Soya Protein, I don't remember TBH.\n\nThere was another that I cannot remember now which was lower in protein, only around 50% compared with around 80% for the previous three.\n\nMost of these are sold as powders from online protein and supplement stores such as Bulk, MyProtein or whichever company serves your country.\n\nIt might be best to get something which is free of any additives such as flavourings and artificial sweeteners because your immune system could react the more ingredients there are. Keep it simple and then you can add to it for taste without throwing the lot in the bin. It gives more chance that you won't react to it. I have considerable experience with autoimmunity. \n\nAs I mentioned I liked the texture of Pea protein but the taste wasn't great but I managed to cover the taste with culinary herbs to make it taste decent.\n\nHuel black\n\nAs long as you're here, I would first ask people to whether they actually agree with your doc's conclusion that becoming vegan would help...\n\nI stopped dairy a while back and switched to vegan. I'm using True Nutrition protein optimizer blend (pea/hemp/rice) and its pretty good. You can completely customize the flavors or add-ons. They also provided test results back when the whole heavy metals thing blew up a few months ago."

    "combined_text": "Title: Question: Dr Jim Stoppani\n\nPost: He is an influencer/ figure on Facebook posting informational clips about lifting, workout, splits, exercises, and nutrition/ supplementation. \n\nHis credentials and experience appear to be legitimate. I like his clips, his advice seems sound. \n\nIn the end, he is selling his products and services. Services are some sort of workout plan, probably includes a nutrition plan. Also, a line of supplements. \n\nThe supplements are suspect, in my opinion. Not because of the contents being not legitimate, but because they are very expensive. Like 70 bucks/ month for one bottle, one month supply. \n\nTwo products are testosterone support. They have several herbs, fernigreek and such. Amino acids. That sort of thing.\n\nThey also contain shilajit, which I know from doing a little reading is generally not legitimate in a capsule form. It needs to be a resin, it's kind of rare and kind of expensive, mixing it up with a bunch of stuff in a capsule is just sort of suspicious. Suspicious for being poor quality, amounts to nothing, a waste of money, is what I mean. \n\nCurious if anyone has any insight or commentary or experience with this individual or his products. I do kind of like the guy, I think he knows his stuff, but I think he might be... I think his profit margins might be massive on these products, which appear to be basic blends of fairly common minerals and herbs and such.. . . that are sold at a fairly exorbitant price.\n\nComments:\nDr Jim Soppani has been around for almost 2 decades.

I think you could have objectively come in 10lbs leaner not including a water cut, definitely have plenty of room.\n\nI think that's pretty generic feedback from an O judge, and any judge at that.

If you had the perfect shape, you wouldn't need to be very close to the cap to be successful, there are plenty of guys that turn pro well under their classic cap. I say all that to say judge feedback for the most part is generic and not very helpful. These guys talk to 50+ competitors at every show and unless they REALLY see something in you and you're the overall winner gearing up for a pro qual run, they give you generic feedback.\n\nThe best thing to do is to look at your physique/stage pics and compare them to all recent pro qual winners in the same/similar height class.

Wasn’t quite as lean as I could’ve been.\n\nGot feedback from Bill Sibilia, an Olympia level judge, he said “You have everything in the right place, shape is perfect, massive potential… but I’d like to see you closer to your weight cap.  Take the year or even 2 to fill out your cap and you’re going to go very far.”\n\nMy original plan was to do this show then rebuild for 2 weeks and then cut for 6 weeks to hit the Hurricane Classic on October 16.  But one of the big take away from the pro seminar (10 Olympia level athletes) was to tune out the noise, listen to your coach and judges feedback…\n\nSo we are taking the feedback and going all in on growth.  Gonna get to my cap next season (PEELED)… was 227 at weigh ins… cap is 242 so if we assume I could’ve been 5 lbs leaner I’ve got 20lbs of tissue to build.\n\nComments:\nCap should be either 239 (up to 6'3) or 246 (up to 6'4).

Basically, I first take a bowl, scoop in the powder, add water and mash up the lumps while stirring vigorously with a fork. What I end up with is something that kind of resembles the sweet-tasting soups I would eat for desert at dim sum restaurants in the same kinds of bowls. It's got a similar thick consistency to it, too.

    "combined_text": "Title: Glycine as a 'Neuro-Brake' for anxiety & sleep... but does it hit the brakes on libido too?\n\nPost: Hey r/Supplements,\n\nI wanted to start a discussion about Glycine, as it's one of the most popular and effective supplements out there for a few key reasons.\n\nFor many, including myself, it's been a game-changer. The general benefits are well-known and seem to work for a lot of people:\n\n* **Improved Sleep Quality:** This is the big one. It can help lower core body temperature and promotes a feeling of calm, leading to deeper, more restorative sleep without morning grogginess.\n* **Calming / Anxiolytic Effects:** It acts as a neurotransmitter, which can help take the edge off anxiety and stress during the day.\n* **Collagen & Connective Tissue Support:** It's a key component of collagen, so it’s great for skin, joint, and bone health.\n* **Glutathione Precursor:** It helps the body produce glutathione, a master antioxidant.\n\n**The Surprising (and Unofficial) Side Effect**\n\nHowever, while digging through forums and anecdotal reports online, I've come across a recurring theme: **a noticeable decrease in libido / sex drive.**\n\nI want to be clear, this is **not** a common side effect listed in major clinical studies, which makes it all the more interesting to discuss from a user-experience. To my knowledge, no study has specifically examined the **relationship** between glycine intake and libido\n\n**Diving into the 'Why': The Plausible Pathways**\n\nBefore just dismissing it,  there are actually a few plausible mechanisms that could explain why this might happen in some individuals:\n\n1. **Glycine as an Inhibitory Neurotransmitter:** This is the most likely explanation. Glycine's main job in the central nervous system is to be a \"brake pedal.\" It calms things down. Sexual arousal and libido, on the other hand, require strong \"gas pedal\" signals from excitatory neurotransmitters (like dopamine). It’s possible that by boosting the body's primary \"brake\" system, Glycine inadvertently dampens the excitatory signals needed for a strong libido in some people.\n2. **The Serotonin Connection:** Some research suggests that Glycine can influence and increase serotonin levels in the brain. As many people know from the side effects of SSRI antidepressants, elevated serotonin is very frequently linked to a decreased sex drive. If Glycine is nudging serotonin levels up, it could potentially be causing a similar, though likely much milder, effect.\n3. **Indirect Hormonal Influence (More Speculative):** Glycine can have some influence on the pituitary gland. Any significant shift in hormones like prolactin could theoretically impact libido, though the evidence for this pathway is much weaker than the first two.\n\n**So, I'm turning to the collective wisdom of this sub:**\n\nI'm curious to see if the anecdotal reports hold any weight in a larger group.\n\n* Has anyone else experienced a noticeable drop in libido while taking glycine?\n* If you did, what was your dosage and when did you take it (e.g., 3g before bed)?\n* Did the effect go away if you stopped or lowered the dose?\n* Conversely, has anyone noticed **no effect** or even a **positive** one on their libido, perhaps due to the benefits of better sleep and lower stress?\n\nGlycine is fantastic for sleep. However, some experienced a potential drop in libido. This could be biologically explained by Glycine's role as a primary \"brake\" (inhibitory) neurotransmitter in the body or its potential to increase serotonin. Wondering if anyone in the community can confirm or deny this from their own experience.\n\nComments:\nRules of r/supplements \n\n1.\nDo Not Suggest Prescription Drugs\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Do Not Suggest Prescription Drugs\nPrescription drugs are not Supplements; do not recommend prescription medication. \nSensible/Suggest talking to DR. can be allowable etc\n                  \n\n2.\nDangerous Grey Area Substance\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Dangerous Grey Area Substance\nPotentially dangerous grey area substances can not be recommended.\n\n\n3.\nBe Polite\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Rude/Personal Attacks\nYou shouldn't ever be personally attacking another user in this subreddit.\n\n\n4.\nNo Advertisements\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Advertisement.

    "combined_text": "Title: Hollow undereyes and temples and collagen degradation after taking a Malaysian supplement laced with corticosteroids (18M)\n\nPost: I’m 18 and I need to ask about something unusual that happened after taking a supplement called Kian Pee Wan which I very recently found out is laced with corticosteroids. I have no idea which corticosteroid exactly. Based on the manufacturer’s other products and what I've read about them it’s most likely dexamethasone.\n\nDuring each period I took this supplement, my temples and under-eyes became hollow noticeably. Before taking it, despite being severely underweight for years, I had a lot of volume just UNDER my eyes and my temples weren’t THAT thin (but my cheeks were, obviously) the back of my jaw didn't look big or anything.\n\nThe hollowing worsened with each round of exposure. Looking back, the changes happened only during the times I took the supplement, I didn’t realize it at the time. This is not normal aging. This time this has become too hard to ignore I cannot keep living in denial and I highly suspect the corticosteroid in the supplement has been somehow hurting. My eyes literally look sunken, my face looks absolutely horrible from below/lower angle. My eyes used to be narrow and wide and now they look rounded as if something is constantly very lightly pulling on the bottom of them and there is this weird ridge on my eyelids from it as if there is excess skin.\n\nIn the Summer of 2024 I did a 1-month course. January 2025, 2 week (ish) course. In last may I did a 3 week course and starting on June 20th I did a roughly 45-day course which is the most recent. now I completely stopped.\n\n\nEven though I gained 20 pounds during the last round NONE of the fat went to my temples. they’re still hollow and look even worse than before\n\nMy arms actually gained subcutaneous fat which is really weird since corticosteroids supposedly cause fat loss in the arms. Yes I did get moon face in the lower half of my face (everything under my cheekbone), my stomach got a little bit bigger, but no fat loss in the arms??\n\n\nI also suspect the corticosteroids severely impacted my collagen and skin health my nasolabial folds are now very pronounced my skin barrier feels destroyed, and skin looks unhealthy overall and aged. Indentations on my forehead appeared that weren’t there before. Also after the first time I tried this supplement, I noticed dehydration lines around my mouth that I had never seen before in my life.\n\n\nI cannot find anybody else that has experienced this issue. Everything on reddit and google talks about moon face, buffalo hump, or peripheral limb fat loss, but nothing like this.\n\nI want to make this clear I did not take prescription corticosteroids deliberately. This was a contaminated supplement. I was laced. I'm not trying to promote anything illegal/dangerous and I don't plan on taking this shit ever again.\n\nHas anyone else experienced hollow temples or under-eyes after corticosteroids? Does anyone know how this might have happened and if this might improve after stopping, losing the gained weight, and waiting long-term? Because that's what I plan on doing. I also plan on taking biosil for my collagen, and a multivitamin since my diet has always been pretty lacking. I would seriously appreciate any insight.\n\nTL;DR: Took a Malaysian supplement (Kian Pee Wan) that was secretly laced with corticosteroids. Instead of just “moon face,” I developed severe hollowing in my temples/under eyes and skin/collagen damage that got worse each round. Stopped now and wondering if anyone else had this and if it can improve long-term\n\nComments:\nRules of r/supplements \n\n1.\nDo Not Suggest Prescription Drugs\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Do Not Suggest Prescription Drugs\nPrescription drugs are not Supplements; do not recommend prescription medication. \nSensible/Suggest talking to DR. can be allowable etc\n                  \n\n2.\nDangerous Grey Area Substance\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Dangerous Grey Area Substance\nPotentially dangerous grey area substances can not be recommended.\n\n\n3.\nBe Polite\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Rude/Personal Attacks\nYou shouldn't ever be personally attacking another user in this subreddit.\n\n\n4.\nNo Advertisements\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Advertisement.

I eat a lot of veggies and chicken, and I try to eat fish/shellfish once a week. \nI was recommended to take a choline supplement to help with adhd since I dont want to take meds for it, and gaba supplement for anxiety.

In the black box, there are smaller amounts of vitamins and mineral complexes. I take them alternately one day the black box, the next day the green box.\n\nI started taking them little by little some based on advice, and some because I felt I might be lacking. Over time, I ended up with a whole box full of pills. I drink 4–5 liters of water daily, go to the gym regularly, had blood tests done, and even asked a doctor if I was doing anything wrong. He said no, but warned me not to overdo it.\n\nI don’t want to stop because whenever I take a week off, I feel terrible. I mainly take them because my diet consists only of meat, rice, and avocado, so I use supplements to cover the micronutrients I don’t get enough of from food.

If you’re after something more basic and smoother, Whey Pro Synergy by Gym High is a solid option.. clean flavour, mixes well, and not overly sweet.  Otherwise, unflavoured whey and  blending it with cocoa or fruit can give you more control over taste without that bitter aftertaste.\n\nI recommend super nutrition's unflavored whey. I love whey. I have here more than 10kg of protein powders, something like 6-7 different flavores of different brands, and I tried a lot others. Super nutrition's unflavored is one of of favorites. Almost no taste, its super thin, they claim for being super clean and it feels like that, easy to drink, mixes super easy, no after taste what so ever, so far havent had that feeling of \"fuck I cant stand that taste anymore\" (and it can happen a lot with whey), wont stick to the edges of your shaker and if you forget to wash your shaker a few days  it wont even smell that bad lol\n\nI can easily chug scoops of it in days my stomach is betraying me without making it worse.\nIts on sale on iherb right now, so youll even get it at a solid price at the moment\n\nThey also have other flavores (vanilla and chocolate) that I love too, but I believe that the unflavored one is the most solid."

But approximately half of the population will need more than the average, thus the RDA of 0.8 g/kg is supposed to cover the protein needs of approximately 98% of the population. It should be noted, though, that most people will need less than 0.8 g/kg (according to this technique).\n\nDon't forget it's also supposed to be for lean body mass, not your bodyweight.\n\nThe people who sell protein powders would prefer you seek to consume more than is available from eating normal high protein meals.\n\nbasically as others said, there's a difference between the minimum needed to be healthy and the maximum you get any benefit from for muscle growth.\n\nthe longest-lived people in the world (the okinawan traditional diet) ate fairly low protein, and they were healthy and lived longer than any other population (it was about 98% plant based, and most of it consisted of the purple sweet potato: fully 70% of their calories came from that one root vegetable; the rest was a mix of things like miso soup and so on).\n\nbut they also were not jacked. so if you want to be jacked, rather than merely healthy and living a long time, you'd need to eat more protein than they did (they got around 5% of their calories from protein). they were healthy, active, and lean, but not muscular.\n\n0.8g/kg is just to be healthy while the 0.8g/lb (\\~1.6g/kg) recommendations are for optimizing muscle growth.\n\nOne is correct for not dying, the other is correct if you are an athlete or trying to grow muscle.\n\n1.6g to 2g per kg bodyweight is what people recommend.. sometimes i hit 2g or more, sometimes its around 1.6-2.0.. anything i between there should be fine. Consistency beats everything at the end, learnt from my mistakes ✅🫡\n\nUhm I guess it depends on which measurement metric they are using. If you’re using kg/g i think it is 1.6 - 2.2 g per kg and for pounds is something around .8g per pound"

Air Fried Crispy Tofu**  \nCrispy, savory tofu in the air fryer with minimal oil, coated with cornstarch, nutritional yeast, seasonings, and a hint of oil.  \n**\\~20g protein | \\~300 calories**  \n— Super easy, high in protein, and delicious!\n\n**2. Ezekiel Bread Chickpea Avocado Toast**  \nMashed chickpeas with spices and a touch of vegan mayo on top of avocado-layered high-protein bread (like Ezekiel).  \n**\\~20g protein | \\~400 calories**  \n— A satisfying, complete-protein toast perfect for any time.\n\n**3. Crispy Edamame** (Biena brand)  \nNo-prep needed, just crunchy edamame that packs a lot of protein for very few calories.  \n**\\~13g protein | \\~130 calories**  \n— One of the leanest, most convenient vegan snacks.\n\n**4. Ezekiel Bread PB&J**  \nClassic PB&J with a healthy twist using sprouted grain bread and sugar-free jam.  \n**\\~15g protein | \\~300 calories**  \n— Great for busy days, with less processing and more nutrition!\n\n**5. Vegan High Protein Pudding**  \nCreamy pudding made with non-dairy milk and a good quality vegan protein powder (try vanilla for dessert vibes). I use a 30g Protein powder for this, add crushed nuts on top.  \n**\\~30g protein | 300–350 calories**  \n— Satisfies your sweet tooth and protein goals at once.\n\n  \nI also made a video here showing how I make these if in case, you're interested: [https://yt.openinapp.co/vsnack](https://yt.openinapp.co/vsnack)\n\nComments:\nMy current favorite is sprouts savory baked tofu (1 piece) sliced then wrapped with teriyaki seaweed snacks. ~200 cal, ~18g of protein\n\n\nPeak lazy, so delicious.\n\nThese high protein \"rice\" crispy treats are my favorite thing ever!\n\nhttps://proteindeficientvegan.com/recipes/high-protein-rice-krispy-treats\n\nRoasted/airfried edamame, roasted/airfried chickpeas, almonds, pumpkin seeds, tofu.

If I don’t have plan on weekend, I add another day of resistance training, focusing on whatever muscle group that’s I want more improvement/not sore. And the 1- 2 days of low intensity cardio for 1+ hr. So I work out at least 5 days a week.\n\nFood wise, I aim to eat 150+g of protein a day. I do track my food and think I’m eating too little calories (too little carbs and fat)….. On a normal day I eat about 1400 cal per day, with a day for social eating (not too crazy maybe 2000-2500 cal). \n\nLogically I think the progress is pretty good, losing 5lbs of fat and maintaining muscle for the past month. But damn my strength is growing so slow and lean mass is not going up :( I would love to keep the fat loss speed but gain a little more muscle, so it’s more like body recomp. Should I increase my carbs intake? I assume it will slow down the fat loss as calories deficit is lower….. but muscle is great. What if i add more cardio session and eat more carbs? Or I should just chill and continue my current routine.\n\nEdit: Forgot to include my height: 5’8” (173cm)\n\n\nComments:\nWith this much exercise and few calories you're headed for everything symptoms and hormone issues unfortunately. \n\nNourishment is your friend.\n\nWhile we all want results RIGHT MEOW! you’ve only been at it for a couple of months!
