Does anyone has good brands/flavours that are good? I've seen Ghost has some flavours but I don't know if they're any good. \n\nComments:\nClear Whey is a thing/brand, haven‚Äôt tried personally\n\nNaked Whey is the best stuff I‚Äôve tried. https://amzn.to/3HqBqXP\n\nNaked whey. One ingredient\n\nI‚Äôve been trying these drinks called protein-o and I find them quite good, they‚Äôre premade and only 90 calories for 20 grams of protein. It also has electrolytes so I like them as a quick after workout refresher. I think the orange mango one tastes like a melted creamsicle(a protein one obviously it‚Äôs not gonna taste like candy don‚Äôt get your hopes too far up) but they‚Äôre quite good in my opinion. They have a few flavors to try out and I‚Äôve found them at Target, but I think they have them at Walmart.",

I regularly go to the gym and lift weights/kettle bell workouts. In the past I‚Äôve eaten out a lot and would eat a lot of high carb meals, my metabolism is pretty fast so I‚Äôve never gained too much weight. \n\nI‚Äôve gotten a lot leaner on keto and have felt great. I‚Äôve been invited to a meal tonight of fried calamari and French fries. \n\nThis motivated me to do some more research on keto and I‚Äôm reading that it can be really bad to have cheat meals. I don‚Äôt NEED to do keto since I‚Äôm generally pretty healthy, but I do like the benefits. As well as the creative meals, like pork grind and cream cheese/shredded cheese crust pizza.  \n\nMy question is - is it harmful to eat Keto meals while also consuming regular meals every now and then? Like protein pasta one night, then a keto pizza the next?\n\nComments:\n‚ÄúCheating‚Äù on keto will result in leaving ketosis (burning fat instead of glucose for energy), so yeah if you‚Äôre trying to eat keto it isn‚Äôt the best choice. \nThat said, eating keto is far from healthy by itself. The only benefit is to cut calories by eliminating carbs as an option and thereby create a caloric deficit to lose weight. It‚Äôs a short term strategy useful because the downsides of being overweight are worse overall. In the long term, eating keto inevitably results in overconsumption of saturated fat, which increases risk of atherosclerosis. Keep eating a high fat diet after you reach a healthy weight, and all you‚Äôll do is get high blood pressure and clogged arteries.\nIt‚Äôs healthier to eat plenty of carbs from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains as well as lean sources of protein, while keeping your calories at maintenance levels.",

        "text": "**Short answer:** \n\nYes, 8g + 36g equals 44g of protein.\n\n**However,** you need to keep in mind that plant-based proteins (most of the time) are the same quality wise with proteins that come from animal products and you often need to make combinations of legumes and grains to get the same result quality wise (a full amino acid profile)\n\n**Detailed explanation:**\n\nProteins are made up of amino acids. When you ingest a protein, your organism breaks it down to its building blocks (amino acids) in the stomach and in the intestines, and uses said amino acids to produce other proteins.   \n\n\nYour body can also produce amino acids, but not all of them. Amino acids are split into essential amino acids (your body cannot produce them at all or can produce them in insufficient quantities) and non-essential amino acids (your body can produce them adequately). **Essential amino acids are the ones you need to take in from food.** \n\nAnimal proteins tend to be complete, i.e. they contain all of the amino acids your body needs to synthesise proteins.  \nPlant-based proteins tend to be incomplete; they don't contain all of the amino acids your body needs to synthesise proteins.\n\n  \nThis is because many plant proteins have what is called a **restrictive** or **limiting amino acid,** the essential amino acid present in the lowest amount relative to what your body needs. **This limiting amino acid prevents your body from fully using the other amino acids in that food for building proteins**. For example, grains like rice are low in lysine, while legumes like beans are low in methionine. By eating them together, their amino acid profiles complement each other and remove this limitation.\n\n**Practical combinations:**\n\n1. **Rice + Beans**: Rice is low in lysine but high in methionine, and beans are low in methionine but high in lysine. Together, they fill each other's gaps.\n2. **Hummus + Whole Wheat Pita**: same as above\n3. **Lentils + Rice**\n4. **Peanut Butter + Bread:** same principle\n5. **Corn + Black Beans**\n\n  \n**Bonus fact:**  \nQuinoa is a pseudograin that is a complete protein itself (also high in methionine, use with beans, lentils)",

If put together, then it has 42 grams of protein? \n\nAnd if a  cup of peas has 8p and a cup of rice 5 grams, then it‚Äôs total of 13 grams of protein. Right?\n\nComments:\nYou‚Äôre right to ask because while total grams add up, not all proteins are equal. Plant proteins like those in peas and rice are often lower in certain essential amino acids compared to animal sources like mozzarella. But when combined like peas and rice, they can complement each other to form a complete protein. So yes, 8g + 5g = 13g, but from a quality standpoint, the amino acid profile matters, too. Great question for anyone optimizing nutrition from mixed sources. I'm curious if you're tracking macros or just aiming to boost protein intake?\n\n**Short answer:** \n\nYes, 8g + 36g equals 44g of protein.\n\n**However,** you need to keep in mind that plant-based proteins (most of the time) are the same quality wise with proteins that come from animal products and you often need to make combinations of legumes and grains to get the same result quality wise (a full amino acid profile)\n\n**Detailed explanation:**\n\nProteins are made up of amino acids. When you ingest a protein, your organism breaks it down to its building blocks (amino acids) in the stomach and in the intestines, and uses said amino acids to produce other proteins.   \n\n\nYour body can also produce amino acids, but not all of them. Amino acids are split into essential amino acids (your body cannot produce them at all or can produce them in insufficient quantities) and non-essential amino acids (your body can produce them adequately). **Essential amino acids are the ones you need to take in from food.** \n\nAnimal proteins tend to be complete, i.e. they contain all of the amino acids your body needs to synthesise proteins.  \nPlant-based proteins tend to be incomplete; they don't contain all of the amino acids your body needs to synthesise proteins.\n\n  \nThis is because many plant proteins have what is called a **restrictive** or **limiting amino acid,** the essential amino acid present in the lowest amount relative to what your body needs. **This limiting amino acid prevents your body from fully using the other amino acids in that food for building proteins**. For example, grains like rice are low in lysine, while legumes like beans are low in methionine. By eating them together, their amino acid profiles complement each other and remove this limitation.\n\n**Practical combinations:**\n\n1. **Rice + Beans**: Rice is low in lysine but high in methionine, and beans are low in methionine but high in lysine. Together, they fill each other's gaps.\n2. **Hummus + Whole Wheat Pita**: same as above\n3. **Lentils + Rice**\n4. **Peanut Butter + Bread:** same principle\n5. **Corn + Black Beans**\n\n  \n**Bonus fact:**  \nQuinoa is a pseudograin that is a complete protein itself (also high in methionine, use with beans, lentils)\n\ni think they work like animal proteins, i don't see any differences\n\nI'm guessing you're thinking about the incomplete protein thing.\n\nIf you have a varied diet you don't really need to worry about that.\n\nVery technically, no, 24g of whey protein is not exactly the same as 24g of a pea/rice blend because of EAA completeness and bioavailability. But it's not a big enough difference to stress over. \n\nThe only one I see commonly recommended to not really count toward your protein totals is pure collagen protein because it's very limited in EAAs.\n\nI think some of the answers here are sort of touching on the idea of amino acids. \n\nOP, if you are curious to look at amino acids more, there is a free tool online where you can estimate the amount of the essential amino acids in a combination of foods, even an entire day's menu, if you like. \n\nThis is a link with a couple of the foods you mentioned already logged in.\n\nThe totals that it adds up on the barchart are for the rdi (minimum recommended daily intake)  for one day, so if you were to log every food you ate in a day, all those totals should be at 100% or more\n\n[https://tools.myfooddata.com/protein-calculator/168878-170016/wt1-wt1/1-1/1](https://tools.myfooddata.com/protein-calculator/168878-170016/wt1-wt1/1-1/1)\n\nBut yes, for total protein,  you can simply add up the grams!\n\nYep, you just add them.

It‚Äôs filling it‚Äôs tasty but is it good?\n\nbeen down that rabbit hole too. tried all the protein-packed health foods that end up having like 40 ingredients. these days i keep it simple. i eat mostly whole foods, but i still want something quick after the gym. atlas bars have been my go-to for a while now. they‚Äôre not perfect, but the ingredients are super clean compared to most. 20g protein, 1g sugar, no seed oils or sucralose junk.",

Focusing on protein is going to help you feel satiated longer and you‚Äôll want some carbs and good fats for some quick energy off the bat and get your brain firing.",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1m1ef2r/simple_guide_for_protein_intake_for_recovery_and/",
    "selftext": "You‚Äôll be familiar with the wellness industry‚Äôs insistence on overcomplicating everything (usually for profit's sake).\n\nProtein guidance for recovery and muscle growth is an obvious example.\n\nSelf-proclaimed experts will try and push obscure ‚Äòresearch‚Äô to encourage you to buy their product or cause controversy on social media.\n\nThis post is all about the clear guidance you need to utilise protein to fuel your recovery and muscle growth.\n\n# Total Daily Protein is the Absolute Priority\n\nThe single most crucial factor for maximising muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and achieving muscle growth is the¬†**overall amount of protein consumed throughout the entire day**. This concept is likened to a \"cake,\" with specific timing of protein intake being merely \"a very thin layer of icing\" on that cake.\n\nThere‚Äôs a clear hierarchy where meeting your total daily protein needs takes precedence over everything else. This means that even if protein intake is not perfectly distributed across meals, for instance, a smaller amount in the morning and a much larger, protein-rich dinner, the body can still effectively utilise that protein for muscle building, provided the daily total is met. Don‚Äôt think you need to front-load 50% of your protein requirement immediately after your workout.\n\n# Optimal Daily Protein Intake for Muscle Building\n\nFor most individuals aiming to build muscle through resistance training, the recommended total daily protein intake is approximately¬†**1.6 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight**, which translates to about¬†**0.7 grams per pound of body weight**. Some recommendations suggest going up to 2 grams per kilogram, or roughly 1 gram per pound, but these don‚Äôt factor in lean muscle mass, so are likely higher than necessary. A meta-analysis of existing literature concluded that as long as total daily protein intake was at or above this range,¬†**the specific timing of protein consumption relative to a workout did not significantly impact muscle gain**.\n\n# The \"Anabolic Window\" is Very Flexible\n\nThe traditional notion of a narrow \"anabolic window,\" which suggested consuming protein and fast-digesting carbohydrates within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise, largely originated from studies where subjects trained in a completely fasted state. However, this concept has limited relevance for most people who consume meals before their workouts. When a mixed meal is eaten pre-exercise, its anabolic and anti-catabolic effects can last anywhere from three to six hours, meaning that¬†**nutrients are often still circulating in the bloodstream during and even after a training session**.\n\nA comprehensive meta-analysis found that if the total daily protein intake is sufficient, the¬†**exact timing of protein relative to the training session makes no meaningful difference**¬†for muscle gain. Furthermore, the actual physiological \"anabolic window\" for muscle protein synthesis is much broader than just a few hours; it¬†**peaks approximately 24 hours after resistance training and remains elevated for as long as 48 to 72 hours**. This indicates that the body has an extended period to utilise available nutrients for muscle repair and growth.\n\n# Meal Timing and Protein Portion Sizes\n\nResearch demonstrates considerable flexibility in when and how much protein one consumes per meal. A study showed¬†**no significant advantage**¬†between consuming protein immediately before exercise versus immediately after. Building on this, another trial specifically examined what happens when individuals neglect all nutrients for three hours both before and after a resistance training bout, while still optimising total daily protein. The results showed¬†**no significant or meaningful difference in muscle size and strength gains**¬†compared to a group that consumed protein immediately around their workout. This means there is¬†**tremendous flexibility**¬†in fitting protein intake into a busy schedule. While studies suggest that doses of around¬†**30 to 50 grams per meal (or 0.4 to 0.6 grams per kilogram of body weight / 0.2 to 0.25 grams per pound of body weight)**¬†appear to maximize muscle protein synthesis¬†*per meal*, the body is also perfectly capable of effectively utilizing much larger protein amounts, such as¬†**75 to 100 grams, from a single meal**¬†for muscle protein synthesis. This is particularly helpful for individuals who find it more practical to consume a significant portion of their daily protein in one or two larger meals, such as dinner.\n\n# Nutrient Availability Trumps Ingestion Time\n\nThe crucial element for muscle protein synthesis is the¬†**presence of nutrients in circulation**, not the precise moment those nutrients are ingested relative to your workout. Nutrients typically¬†**peak in the bloodstream one to two hours after consumption**. Therefore, if you eat protein before a workout, those amino acids will become available in your system during or shortly after your training, ready for use by your muscles. This clarifies why a rush for immediate post-workout protein is often unnecessary, especially if a pre-workout meal has been consumed.\n\n\\---\n\nTaken from r / healthchallenges",

Any flatbread crust, tomato sauce, 2% mozzarella cheese, and turkey pepperoni. I do a 1-to-1 ratio serving and it comes out to 390 calories and the volume and taste is GREAT. Macros come to 49g carbs, 12g fat, and 24g protein, been eating this for 2 years and I look forward to it every time.",

When he really looked at the label today, he says that there's no way they're 70 calories and should be double due to the total amount of carbs. Is he right? He was upset since he thinks it's messed up his tracking.",
