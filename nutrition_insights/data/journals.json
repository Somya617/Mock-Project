This study aimed to investigate the effects of canagliflozin (an SGLT2i) on salt-sensitive hypertensive kidneys. Male Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt (8%) diet and then orally administered canagliflozin 30 mg/kg/day or 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solution for 12 weeks. Thus, a high-salt-induced model of hypertensive kidney injury with premature aging was established to evaluate the protective effects and related mechanisms of canagliflozin on hypertensive kidneys. Canagliflozin reduced blood pressure, the serum creatinine concentration, and urinary albumin excretion in high-salt rats. Hematoxylin and eosin, Masson, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (staining were performed on rat kidneys, revealing that canagliflozin alleviated renal fibrosis and premature aging. Immunohistochemical analysis and protein detection demonstrated that canagliflozin increased the expression of silent information regulator 6 (SIRT6) in the kidney, inhibited the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) protein and its target genes, and alleviated kidney damage and premature aging. In summary, canagliflozin ameliorates renal injury and premature aging in male Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed high salt with associated changes in SIRT6/HIF-1α signaling.",

The impact of pH-regulated and OFE modification on the structure, emulsification properties, and CEO release behavior of WPF-OFE was systematically examined. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and molecular docking analyses revealed that OFE provided the basis for the formation of the ordered structure, and the main interactions between WPF and OFE were hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.

As global initiatives prioritize circular economy strategies, the demand for biodegradable and recyclable alternatives to single-use, petroleum-based polymers has intensified. Paper packaging emerges as a promising candidate, despite inherent barrier performance limitations. This review examines recent advancements in enhancing paper-based packaging through biopolymer coatings and nanocomposites. It investigates utilization of various biopolymers including polysaccharides (cellulose, starch, chitosan, alginate), lignin, proteins (soy, whey, zein, gluten, casein), lipid, and various aliphatic polyesters, based on their potential to improve barrier properties against oxygen, moisture, and microbial contamination. The synergistic effects of incorporating nanomaterials into biopolymer matrices are discussed, highlighting their role in augmenting mechanical and different barrier characteristics. The review encompasses different barrier property requirements for flexible food packaging materials, biopolymer utilization in paper coatings using various approaches, and the potential of different nanomaterials and their composites. It also discusses multi-phase and multi-layer coating strategies for imparting multifunctional properties to paper-based packaging. Furthermore, the study addresses biodegradability, recyclability, challenges, and future opportunities in this field, providing insights into sustainable packaging solutions that balance environmental concerns with food safety and quality.",

However, the retrogradation and digestibility of retrograded intracellular starch has rarely been investigated, and our preliminary results indicated the difficulty of intracellular starch retrogradation. To test mechanistic principles of intracellular starch retrogradation, intact pulse cells were extracted and treated with protease followed by pancreatic α-amylase (0-20 min) and pullulanase (24 h) prehydrolysis, and then controlled retrogradation (4 °C, 5 d). Protein hydrolysis had little effect on starch retrogradation and digestibility, showing no change in the crystallinity, retrogradation enthalpy change and extent of digestion, compared to the cooked sample. Meanwhile, additional 5 min of α-amylase hydrolysis maximized the retrogradation of intracellular starch likely by producing perfect chain length for retrogradation, which then exhibited the lowest digestion rate and extent (0.0172 min-1 and 29.8 %). Further increasing α-amylase hydrolysis reduced crystallinity and enthalpy, leading to decreased retrogradation and increased digestibility. These findings shed new light on the mechanism underlying intracellular starch retrogradation and the extending application of retrograded starch with low propensity to negatively affect texture.",

Through systematic evaluation of SPI-based composite gel substitution levels (0, 50, 75, and 100 %) on quality parameters, we demonstrated that this biomimetic system significantly enhanced moisture content, protein levels, pH, L* and a*, while reducing total fat, calories, cooking loss, and lipid oxidation.

Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging evaluations confirmed an improved water-holding capacity and uniform water distribution. This optimal formulation demonstrated enhanced water-holding capacity (89.47 ± 2.34 %), reduced cooking losses (9.39 ± 0.69 %), and achieved superior sensory acceptance (82.2 ± 4.97). Therefore, the SPI-based composite gel functions as a viable nutritional fat substitute in the production of low-fat, high-quality emulsified sausages without compromising textural or sensory attributes.

This study investigated the effects of digests from oxidized MPs collected from bighead carp on Caco-2 cell viability, oxidative and inflammatory responses. The intestinal transport of peptides in these digests was studied using a model of Caco-2 simulated intestinal epithelial layer. Results suggest that treatment with digests of oxidized MPs not only induces ROS and inflammatory stress of Caco-2 cells (evidenced by increased ROS levels, increased mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β, and decreased enzyme activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx), but also negatively affects cell viability. Moreover, protein oxidation altered peptide transport characteristics across the Caco-2 monolayer, resulting in lower permeability of bioactive peptides. These findings underscore the impact of exposure to oxidized protein digests on cellular health and provide insights into the potential risks of consuming oxidized MPs.",

Inflammation alters junction proteins, resulting in increased permeability, and may also influence the response pattern of barrier proteins responsible for intracellular nutrient transport. Focusing on the MFSD2a protein (major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2 A), which is present in the BBB, is an important translocator of omega-3 fatty acid (ω3) from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS), this study aimed to assess the impact of obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HF) on the MFSD2a modulation in the hypothalamus of mice. Male Swiss mice were subjected to HF, and after the onset of obesity, the MFSD2a gene expression, protein content, and their distribution through the hypothalamic areas were measured. Also, obese animals were treated with ω3-rich oil orally to measure the ω3 translocation to the brain. Palmitate or TNFα was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) to test the mechanism enrolled on MFSD2a modulation. Surprisingly, MFSD2a was increased in the hypothalamic MFSD2a induced by HF consumption. The biomolecular mapping showed wide MFSD2a distribution throughout the different hypothalamic nuclei but increased in arcuate and paraventricular nucleus induced by HF-diet. The ω3 translocator is modulated over the animal's lifetime under both CT and HF diets. The i.c.v. administration of TNFα or palmitic did not alter the translocator, thus, the mechanistic influence of obesity on MFSD2a is still open. The supply of ω3-rich oils to obese mice had no impact on their central bioaccessibility. These nutrigenomic approaches revealed that not only the obesogenic process impacts the MFSD2a protein in the hypothalamus but also environmental and life circumstances.",

Radio frequency (RF) heating has shown potential to enhance rice flour quality by modulating gelatinization. However, the dynamic evolution of physicochemical properties and the associated structural transitions during RF-induced gelatinization remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated effects of RF treatment at 6 target temperatures (34, 39, 48, 54, 63, and 72 °C) under the corresponding gelatinization degree (GD) levels (15 %, 30 %, 45 %, 60 %, 75 %, and 90 %) on structures and physicochemical properties of protein and starch in rice flour. Results showed that physicochemical properties and structural changes of rice flour were closely associated with the GD during RF-induced gelatinization. With increasing GD of rice flour, functional properties (swelling power, foaming capacity, and emulsifying capacity), pasting viscosity (peak, trough, and final viscosity) and nutritional components (total protein, crude fat, and amylose content) showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, peaking at moderate gelatinization (45 or 60 % GD) levels. Structural analysis revealed that the increased GD of rice flour promoted protein aggregation on the surface of starch particles, reduced values of short-range ordered structure, relative crystallinity, and enthalpy values, and altered secondary and tertiary structures of proteins. This study may elucidate the correlation mechanism between structure and performance during RF-induced gelatinization, providing a theoretical basis for the application of RF technology in the modification of gluten-free rice flour.",

Furthermore, this study experimentally analyzed the functional properties of myosin-PC-DHA complex. The spectroscopy showed that PC-DHA interacted with myosin through static quenching to form a stable complex. MDS demonstrated that PC-DHA induced conformational changes in myosin by altering the strength and direction of movement of key amino acid residues. Moreover, MDS revealed that the interaction with PC-DHA increased the solvent contact area and irregularly curled structure of myosin, giving myosin a higher solvent-accessible surface area and more contact sites. These structural changes promoted improved gelling and emulsifying properties of myosin.

Due to its smaller molecular size, catechin more easily penetrated the hydrophobic cores of proteins, yielding higher binding stoichiometry and concentration-dependent aggregation. At 4 mM, extensive aggregation masked proteolytic cleavage sites, reducing gastrointestinal digestibility by 7.3 % for 7S and 15.1 % for 11S. In contrast, EGCG, with an additional galloyl moiety and a denser hydroxyl network, interacted with proteins through synergistic hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic forces. It produced more stable supramolecular complexes with much larger diameters (462.2 ± 6.8 nm for 11S-EGCG, versus 30.3 ± 1.5 nm for native 11S), and lowered IgE-binding capacity by approximately 19.5-38.7 %, probably through epitope masking and surface-charge changes. For both polyphenols, binding significantly decreased solvent accessibility of hydrophobic regions, reorganized secondary structure (α-helix loss and β-sheet gain), and markedly enhanced intrinsic antioxidant capacity.

Moreover, the addition of Arg significantly enhanced the stability of the emulsions, with those prepared at 30 °C exhibiting the highest stability. These findings could be attributed to the fact that under the stirring temperature of 30 °C and in the presence of Arg, the depolymerization of gelatin increased, leading to a significant increase in the hydrophobic β-sheet structures (P < 0.05), which in turn resulted in a significant increase in the exposure of hydrophobic amino acids and negatively charged residues on the gelatin surface (P < 0.05).

Marine-derived glycoproteins have received widespread attention for multiple activities and due to their lack of side effects, but sea cucumber glycoproteins (SCGP) and their hypoglycemic mechanisms remain unexplored. In this study, SCGP was investigated for its effects on the hepatic and intestinal glucose metabolism transport mechanisms by establishing a PDM mouse model through high-fat and high-sugar diet feeding. The results demonstrated that SCGP could restore fasting glucose and oral glucose tolerance to normal levels, improve postprandial glucose, insulin resistance and lipid levels, and enhance insulin sensitivity in PDM mice. Additionally, the results demonstrated that SCGP improved hepatic glucose metabolism by up-regulating the INSR/PI3K/AKT pathway, which could also alleviate insulin resistance. Moreover, SCGP promoted the intestinal barrier by upregulating zonula occludin and mucin 2, and it enhanced small intestine glucose transport and absorption by regulating the PLCβ2/PKCα/SGLT1-GLUT2 pathway. Furthermore, SCGP regulated the abundance of Lactobacillus, Roseburia and Faecalibaculum linked to DM at the genus level. Overall, this study demonstrated the potential of SCGP in intervening in hyperglycemia, preventing PDM from developing into DM, which provides a theoretical foundation for the development of natural functional products related to the intervention of PDM.",

Moreover, the thermal stability and emulsifying property of the WP-GA-PC ternary conjugates were significantly improved compared with the WP-GA conjugates. The addition of PC improved the interfacial properties of the conjugates, which was favorable to the formation of stable emulsions. The emulsion activity index and emulsion stability index were increased by 10.73 m",

In this study, peanut meal (PM) was enzymatically hydrolyzed using three proteases and fractionated by ultrafiltration. Among the resulting fractions, peanut peptide (PEP) in the 3 kDa-500 Da range demonstrated superior α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (69.5 %), peptide yield (85.75 %), and peptide content (1.55 ± 0.05 mg/mL). In a high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes (T2DM) mouse model, high-dose PEP (PEP-H) effectively reduced blood glucose and lipid levels, alleviated liver damage, and relieved the symptoms of T2DM. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses revealed that PEP modulated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism via the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway. Finally, four peptides (AFPKFR, APPFDPNKPK, PFPIK, and FATPVPLPK) exhibiting the strongest α-glucosidase-binding ability were identified from PEP using LC-MS/MS and molecular docking analysis. Notably, APPFDPNKPK and FATPVPLPK exhibited the highest inhibitory activity (64.3 % and 75.4 %, respectively) via mixed-type inhibition. This study highlights a novel value-added strategy for the utilization of PM proteins and provides essential peptide candidates for developing innovative antidiabetic drugs and functional foods.",

The incorporation of Qingke powder into soybean paste enhances both its flavor and nutritional profile. However, there is a need to deepen the understanding of how microbial communities and physicochemical changes contribute to the flavor and nutritional characteristics of Qingke-based fermented products. This study investigated the physicochemical properties, volatile compounds, and microbial community dynamics in Qingke bean paste (QBP) throughout the fermentation process. Significant increases in titratable acid, amino acid content, and enzyme activity were observed over the fermentation period. The dominant microorganisms identified included Bacillus, Pediococcus, Issatchenkia, and Aspergillus. Although the abundance of both Bacillus and Aspergillus gradually decreased, the abundance of Pediococcus and Issatchenkia increased. Redundancy analysis revealed salinity and moisture as the primary factors driving microbial community changes. Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated a strong positive relationship between the volatile compounds in QBP and the presence of Bacillus and Issatchenkia, indicating their key roles in flavor development. This study provides valuable insights into the taxonomic shifts in microbial communities and the formation of flavor metabolites during QBP fermentation, offering a foundation for further advancements in the processing of Qingke-based products.",

However, current 3D food printers face challenges in achieving large-scale production due to their slow printing speeds and low printing efficiency. In this study, hydrocolloids including gelatin (GL), xanthan gum (XG), and flaxseed gum (FG) were incorporated into the existing strawberry and pea protein isolate (PPI) gel and a multi-nozzle printer was designed, aiming to achieve highly efficient 3D food printing. Results showed that the incorporation of hydrocolloids enhanced the optimal printing speed from 20 mm/s to 50 mm/s, while the utilization of a multi-nozzle printer decreased the time required to produce a printing product from 610 s to 58 s. Moreover, there was no noticeable difference in appearance or size for the dual-nozzle and six-nozzle printing products. The hydrocolloids (GL and FG) enhanced the rheological properties and textural structure of the strawberry-PPI gels by increasing the bound water content, which improved the mechanical properties and 3D printing performance. The extruded filament surface of strawberry-PPI gels became smoother and the internal structure of the gels became denser with the incorporation of hydrocolloids. The results from the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) indicated that the 3D printed products met the requirements for level-4 dysphagia foods. It can be concluded that both the incorporation of hydrocolloids and the development of multi-nozzle fixtures can enhance printing speed and facilitate large-scale production, offering valuable insights for the future of efficient 3D food printing.",

The efficacy of germinated red bean extract and its bioactive compound, azukisaponin II (AZ), on anti-obesity has been reported very little to date. This study aims to investigate the anti-obesity effects of red bean seedling extract (RS) and AZ, on PPARα and AMPKα signaling pathways in white adipose tissue. RS supplementation effectively reduced fat mass and improved lipid metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice. RS decreased body weight gain, reduced adipocyte size, and lowered plasma triglyceride, free fatty acids, and total cholesterol. RS also enhanced mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation by activating AMPKα signaling and upregulating PPARα expression in white adipose tissue. In particular, the levels of lipolysis-related factors (ATGL, HSL, and PLIN5) and proteins in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (NDUFB8, SDHB, UQCRC2, MTCO1, ATP5A) were increased in the RS200 and RS300 groups. RS and AZ treatments inhibited adipogenesis and promoted lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, we confirmed that treating PPARα-knockdown 3T3-L1 cells with RS and AZ alleviates lipid accumulation by activating PPARα-AMPKα signaling. RS supplementation effectively reduces obesity in HFD-induced mice by enhancing lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function through PPARα-AMPKα signaling. Additionally, RS and AZ decrease lipid accumulation and promote mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating their potential for treating obesity and metabolic disorders with a favorable safety profile.",

However, the bioavailability of its conjugated linolenic acids, an essential factor for assessing their impact on health, remains poorly understood. This study used the harmonized in vitro protocol INFOGEST to investigate the bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil in comparison to olive oil. Bioaccessibility, key aspect of bioavailability, refers to the proportion of a nutrient released in the gastrointestinal tract and available for intestinal absorption. It was determined by measuring the ratio of fatty acids present in the absorbable fraction (monoglycerides and free fatty acids) to total fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography following solid-phase extraction. Results showed that the overall bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil was equivalent to that of olive oil. Notably, punicic acid (in pomegranate seed oil) and oleic acid (in olive oil) - both 18‑carbon fatty acids present in equivalent quantities in the two oils, showed high and equivalent bioaccessibility. The presence of proteins (whey and soy protein isolates) did not affect the bioaccessibility of the major fatty acids under experimental conditions. The recovery index was high for all fatty acids, indicating minor degradation during in vitro digestion, and was not affected by the presence of oxygen. In conclusion, punicic acid is efficiently released by digestive lipases, suggesting good bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil.

In this study, we explored a promising alternative of curcumin-mediated photodynamic treatment (PDT) for the inhibition of B. cereus and the preservation of FRN quality. We optimized the processing parameters of PDT for FRN sterilization, using illumination at 30000 lx, a curcumin solution at 40 μmol/L, and an exposure time of 18 min, through single-factor experiments and central composite response design. After treatment, PDT significantly inhibited B. cereus (P < 0.05) in FRN at low and medium contamination levels both at 4 and 30 °C, reducing it to below the maximum acceptable enumeration. Moreover, PDT inhibited the rapid proliferation of B. cereus during the first 48 and 24 h at 4 and 30 °C, respectively, preventing the bacterial population from exceeding the acceptable limit for FRN. For authentic FRN samples, the results of preservation effects indicated that PDT notably inhibited the growth of hygienic indicator bacteria, putrefactive bacteria, and foodborne pathogenic bacteria during the entire storage period at 4 °C. During this bacterial guarantee period, PDT significantly slowed the accumulation of acidity and the loss of rice aroma and flavor substances in FRN. Although it mildly caused texture profile and color deterioration, the alterations remained within the acceptable range. Moreover, negligible loss of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were observed in the PDT-treated sample. Microbiome analysis indicated that PDT reduced the relative abundance of the dominant spoilage species Lactobacillus and Lactococcus in FRN. In conclusion, PDT is an emerging non-thermal sterilization process for controlling the risk of pathogens in FRN and preserving its quality. We proposed an integrative strategy in which curcumin-mediated PDT combined with chilled storage could effectively prevent and control B. cereus contamination in FRN and enhance preservation for FRN.",

Special oilseed proteins are extracted from these special oilseeds and feature high digestibility and an acceptable flavor. They are expected to complement the deficiencies of bulk proteins and expand the plant protein resource pool. Consequently, this paper reviews the enrichment, composition, functional properties, and application status of several common special oilseed proteins (sunflower seed protein, flaxseed protein, sesame seed protein, hemp seed protein, walnut protein, and perilla seed protein). The aim is to understand the development status of special oilseed proteins comprehensively, explore effective strategies to break through their application bottlenecks, and thus expand the possibilities of their applications. At present, special oilseed proteins possess excellent nutritional and functional properties and have broad application prospects. Nevertheless, the enrichment techniques for special oilseed proteins in food processing are restricted compared to the comprehensive application systems of bulk oilseed proteins. The relatively high proportion of non-protein components in the raw materials hampers their extraction, leading to a low extraction rate. Additionally, common issues among plant proteins, such as low solubility and incomplete amino acid composition, also limit their applications. Integrating new and traditional extraction methods, formulating multiple protein combinations, and modifying functional properties will contribute to the further application of special oilseed proteins.",

Derived from natural sources such as soil and vegetation decomposition, natural DOM (N-DOM) typically features humic-like substances with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups that stabilize heavy metals through complexation. However, microplastic-derived DOM (MP-DOM), increasingly prevalent due to plastic degradation, may interact differently with heavy metals, potentially exacerbating environmental risks amid rising plastic pollution. Yet, how heavy metals drive molecular transformations in MP-DOM versus N-DOM remains unclear, hindering accurate pollution assessments. Here, we compare interactions between N-DOM and MP-DOM with cadmium, chromium (Cr), copper, and lead from both fluorescence and molecular perspectives. Our results show that N-DOM, dominated by humic-like substances (46.0-57.3 %), lignin-like (55.0-64.9 %), and tannin-like (10.1-17.6 %) compounds, forms more stable heavy metal complexes via carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, and ether groups than MP-DOM. By contrast, MP-DOM-enriched in protein/phenolic-like substances (13.8-24.0 %), condensed aromatic (12.1-28.5 %), and protein/aliphatic-like (8.6-12.4 %) compounds-yields less stable complexes and is highly susceptible to Cr-induced oxidation. Mass-difference network analysis and density functional theory calculations further reveal that both DOM types undergo heavy-metal-triggered decarboxylation and dealkylation, but N-DOM retains complex structures, whereas MP-DOM degrades into smaller, hazardous molecules such as phenol and benzene. This study underscores the potential for heavy metals to exacerbate the ecological risks associated with the transformation of MP-DOM, providing crucial insights to inform global risk assessment and management strategies in contaminated waters where plastic and metal pollution co-occur.",

However, the mechanisms by which osteoclasts perceive and respond to mechanical disturbances remain unclear. Through integrating multi-omics data of bone tissues from hindlimb unloading (HLU) and control mice, it is revealed that glutamine (Gln) catabolism-induced suppression of apoptosis is critical for monocytes sensing and responding to mechanical unloading. Gln uptake is essential for the survival of monocytes under mechanical unloading. Deprivation of Gln or blockade of Gln transporter solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) inhibits bone resorption by enhancing apoptosis of monocytes. Unloading exposure-induced cell survival is mediated by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)/direct IAP binding protein with low pI (Diablo) axis. Upon mechanical unloading XIAP is upregulated, then interacts with Diablo in mitochondrial and promotes the K63-linkage ubiquitylation of Diablo at the K212 site. This sequesters Diablo within the mitochondrial and inhibits its release into the cytosol, ultimately inhibiting cell apoptosis of osteoclasts and the precursors. Clinically, the serum Gln levels are positively correlated with cross linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) levels, indicating that serum Gln levels might serve as a potential biomarker for predicting the risk of osteoporosis. Gln-deficient diet, as well as SLC1A5 inhibitor L-γ-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (GPNA), effectively preserves bone mass in HLU mice, implicating attractive approaches for combating bone loss induced by weightlessness or disuse.",

    "combined_text": "Environmental NaCl affects Caenorhabditis elegans development and aging.\n\nSodium chloride (NaCl) is an essential nutrient, but it is toxic in excess. In humans, excessive dietary NaCl can cause high blood pressure, which contributes to age-related diseases, including stroke and heart disease. We used Caenorhabditis elegans to elucidate how NaCl levels influence animal aging. Most experiments on this animal are conducted in standard culture conditions: Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar with a lawn of E. coli. Here, we report that the supplemental NaCl in standard NGM, ∼50 mM, accelerates aging and decreases lifespan. For comparison, we prepared NGM with reduced NaCl or excess NaCl. Considering reduced NaCl as a baseline, wild-type worms on standard NGM displayed normal development and fertility but reduced lifespan and health span, indicating toxicity in old animals. The long-lived mutants daf-2, age-1, and nuo-6, cultured on standard NGM, also displayed reduced lifespan. Thus, NaCl in standard NGM accelerates aging in multiple genetic backgrounds. Wild-type worms on excess NaCl displayed delayed development and reduced fertility, and reduced lifespan and health span, indicating toxicity in both young and old animals. These results suggest that young animals are relatively resistant to NaCl toxicity, but that aging causes progressive sensitivity, such that old animals display toxicity to both standard and excess NaCl. We investigated pathways that respond to NaCl. Young animals cultured with excess NaCl activated gpdh-1, a specific response to NaCl stress. Old animals cultured with excess NaCl activated gpdh-1 and hsp-6, a reporter for the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Thus, excess NaCl activates multiple stress response pathways in older animals.",

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), a highly aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract with poor prognosis, the latest clinical trials using TGF-β inhibitors have failed indicating that the specific actions carried out by TGF-β in iCCA are yet not well delineated. Here, we show that TGF-β signalling is highly active in iCCA and exerts a prominent suppressor effect on tumour cell lines and organoids established from iCCA metastases biopsies, that relies on a functional canonical SMAD2/3/4 signalling. Thus, TGF-β inhibitors promote, instead of inhibiting, tumour cell growth. In this context, a promising strategy is to target intracellular proteins downstream the TGF-β receptors accounting only for TGF-β pro-tumorigenic actions. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a downstream mediator of the TGF-β signalling pathway, is strictly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) of iCCA and acts in concert with NOX1 to regulate CAF functions. Use of a dual NOX4/NOX1 inhibitor impaired CAF actions and reduced tumour growth in vitro and in two different in vivo iCCA experimental models. Collectively, our findings reveal an actionable way to specifically target TGF-β pro-tumorigenic actions in CAF from iCCA without undesirable side effects on tumour cells, suggesting a potentially bright future for dual NOX4/NOX1 inhibitors in the clinics, alone or in combination with other therapies.",

Select three-year-old sheep grassland as the experimental field, diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6), brassinolide (BR), and melatonin (MT) were sprayed to explore the regulatory mechanisms and differential efficacy of different phytohormones on grassland productivity. MT promotes chlorophyll synthesis, drives enhanced photosynthesis and protein synthesis, DA-6 upregulated photochemical efficiency and improves the stability of light energy conversion. BR enhances water use efficiency (WUE) through synergistic effects of pore regulation. MT demonstrated significant in the accumulation of biomass during the early and middle growth stages, and upgrade the nutritional quality of forage. DA-6 is suitable for biomass accumulation in the later growth stage. BR has outstanding potential in water conservation and stress resistance capacity. This study elucidates the differences in the regulatory effects of different growth regulators on the productivity of sheep pastures, in order to providing technical insights to optimize the technical strategy for grassland restoration and mitigate the contradiction between the degradation of natural grasslands and the development of animal husbandry.",

Immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assays and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) in combination with proteomics sequencing in HSCs were used to study the associated downstream mechanisms.\n\nISG15 was underexpressed in activated HSCs and fibrotic livers, showing an inverse correlation with α-smooth muscle actin in patients with liver fibrosis. ISG15cKO mice developed spontaneous hepatic fibrosis and showed exacerbated CCl4/BDL-induced fibrogenesis. In vitro, ISG15 modulated HSC activation, proliferation and excessive extracellular matrix production. ISG15 deficiency in HSCs promoted transforming growth factorβ2 (TGFβ2) transcription by enhancing phosphorylated cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) activity, thereby inducing CREB1 binding on TGFβ2 promoter regions to activate TGFβ2/SMAD2 signalling. ISGylation directly binds CREB1 on Lys-304 and Lys-305 to inhibit p-CREB1 activity. Overexpression of ISG15 in HSCs or pharmacological inhibition of CREB1 by 666-15 could abolish ISG15 deficiency-induced liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated mice.\n\nISG15 regulated HSC activation and liver fibrosis in part via the CREB1/TGFβ2/SMAD2 regulatory pathway.

There is limited evidence in the current medical literature to determine whether a vegan diet is adequate for children, since the currently available society position papers are based on narrative reviews and expert opinion. Updated evidence-based recommendations are needed to guide clinical practice. This position paper presents findings from a literature review performed using a systematic search strategy, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We analyzed the current evidence on the effect of vegan diet compared to omnivorous diet on body growth, nutritional adequacy and laboratory biomarkers in infants, children and adolescents. Observational studies, cohort studies and clinical trials published over the last 15 years in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were retrieved. Our position paper aims to update the evidence for or against the adequacy of a vegan diet in infants, children and adolescents and to provide evidence-based recommendations. A total of 10 articles were accepted and included in the final review, providing information on approximately 1500 children following a vegan diet. Several articles assessed more than one outcome: seven addressed body growth, five evaluated nutritional adequacy and five examined laboratory biomarkers. To complement the primary data, three systematic reviews and meta-analyses were also included. Current evidence is inconclusive to determine whether a strictly vegan diet supports normal childhood growth, although no significant differences in height or body mass index z-scores were observed compared to omnivorous peers. We recommend that dietary intake, growth and nutritional status should be regularly monitored in vegan children. Focusing on dietary intakes (e.g., protein, omega-3, calcium and iron) and ensuring supplementation with specific micronutrients, including vitamin B12, is essential during paediatric age when following a strict vegan diet. Clinical research, well-designed prospective studies and high-quality trials are required to address current research gaps.",

    "combined_text": "Is There Conservation of Vitellogenins in a Placentotrophic Lizard?\n\nIn vertebrates, the provision of nutrients to developing embryos varies widely, ranging from yolk-dependent strategies to highly specialized forms of placental nourishment. Vitellogenins (VTGs) are essential proteins for egg yolk formation in oviparous and lecithotrophic species. In contrast, in eutherian mammals, the loss of VTGs is associated with the evolution of matrotrophy (placentotrophy and lactation), where maternal nutrition via the placenta replaces the need for large yolk reserves during embryonic development. Marisora sp., a placentotrophic viviparous lizard with the most complex placenta known in reptiles, exhibits truncated vitellogenesis, resulting in the production of microlecithal eggs. This study investigated the presence of VTGs in Marisora sp. using RNA-seq from the liver and ovary at previtellogenesis and vitellogenesis stages. No corresponding annotations for VTGs were found. This absence may be associated with the placentotrophic nutrition of the embryo, suggesting modifications in lipid production and transport to the ovarian follicles. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and microsomal triglyceride transfer proteins (MTP) were identified, which are closely related to VTGs and could fulfill their function, especially ApoB, which is involved in yolk formation in lecithotrophic species in which VTGs are absent. The absence of VTGs in the Marisora sp. transcriptome represents a key discovery in the evolution of obligate placentotrophic viviparity in reptiles, highlighting convergent traits with mammals. Genomic studies are required to determine if changes in VTG genes prevent or modify their expression, and proteomic studies are needed to fully understand the role of other lipid transport proteins in the preovulatory ovarian follicles of these lizards.",

Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), one of the main active ingredients in the Chinese herbal Astragalus film, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasoprotective pharmacological activities. Therefore, we hypothesized that AS-IV may induce the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hJBMMSCs), which is key to its potential application in the regeneration and repair of oral and maxillofacial bone tissue defects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of AS-IV on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hJBMMSCs and the mechanisms involved. In this in vitro study, the cytotoxicity of AS-IV to hJBMMSCs was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated via alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium nodule formation, osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression, and osteogenic protein levels. In addition, the potential molecular mechanism underlying AS-IV-induced osteogenic differentiation of hJBMMSCs was preliminarily explored using LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT antagonist. AS-IV significantly promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hJBMMSCs at tested concentrations. Notably, treatment with 40 µM AS-IV supplemented in differentiation medium significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and mineral deposition. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR revealed that 40 µM AS-IV increased the expression of osteogenic and angiogenic genes such as ALP, Runx2, OPN, OCN, CD31, VEGF, and Ang-1 in hJBMMSCs. Western blot analysis further showed that 40 µM AS-IV upregulated the levels of the osteogenic proteins Runx-2 and OCN. These effects may be mediated by AS-IV through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Overall, AS-IV promotes hJBMMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and upregulating osteogenic and angiogenesis-related genes.",

Using a rodent model of obesity, we performed a comparative quantitative proteomic approach of heart samples from standard, high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD+GSE groups. LTQ OrbiTrap technology, followed by bioinformatic tools, allowed the identification of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). GSE alleviated the HFD-induced energy metabolism alteration by recovering and/or enhancing some DAPs, such as the aconitase and the propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Also, GSE renews the capacity of cardiomyocytes to produce energy by an overabundance of complex I and complex III. Additionally, GSE improved the contractile function and alleviated cardiomyopathy in obesity following an overabundance of key contractile proteins like myosins and actinin. This study demonstrates that GSE confers cardioprotective effects in the context of obesity-induced metabolic disturbances. Through a proteomic approach, we identified key DAPs involved in energy metabolism and contractile function that were positively modulated by GSE.

Here we assessed whether the proinflammatory angiotensin-converting enzyme - angiotensin receptor type 1 (ACE-AT1R) axis and the anti-inflammatory angiotensin-converting enzyme 2- MAS1 receptor (ACE2-MAS1) axis RAAS components are influenced by the consumption of a KD rich either in saturated fatty acids (SFA-KD) or polyunsaturated linoleic acid (LA-KD) in healthy and inflamed intestine of C57BL/6J male mice. In healthy jejunum, KD increased the AT2R protein level and decreased Ace2 level regardless of the fat source, whereas in the healthy colon, the RAAS components were unaffected by the dietary interventions. In colon, administration of 2.5 % (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 5 days upregulated ACE protein while downregulating Agtr2 gene expression. These DSS-induced changes were absent in both KD groups. Furthermore, the DSS-SFA-KD group exhibited lower angiotensinogen gene expression than the DSS animals.

Dietary intakes were assessed using the 24-hour dietary recall. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Dose-response relationships were evaluated using restricted cubic splines.\n\nOver a median follow-up of 8.5 years, 1,715 deaths were documented. Lower isoflavone intake was associated with a higher mortality risk, with a plateau in risk at higher intake levels. Compared with the lowest quintile of isoflavone intake (<1.3 mg/day), HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality in the second to fifth quintiles were 0.72 (0.62, 0.84), 0.72 (0.62, 0.84), 0.76 (0.66, 0.88), and 0.74 (0.65, 0.85), respectively. For cardiovascular disease mortality, a significantly lower risk was observed in the third quintile compared with the lowest quintile (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.96). The highest quintile of isoflavone intake was associated with lower risks of cancer (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.99) and respiratory disease mortality (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.77) compared with the lowest quintile. Similar patterns were observed for soy protein and soy food intake. Dose-response relationships were nonlinear, with the lowest all-cause mortality risk observed around median intake levels (9 mg/day for isoflavones, 4 g/day for soy protein, and 33 g/day for soy foods).\n\nOur findings suggest that lower intakes of soy and isoflavones are associated with a higher risk of mortality in the population where soy consumption is prevalent.",

Traditional nutritional research is often hampered by environmental variability, low precision, and the complexity of nutrient interactions across different tissues. The advent of high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics, and functional genomics has driven the rapid emergence of various omics fields, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics. These technologies overcome the limitations of traditional research methods, becoming powerful tools for investigating the regulatory mechanisms of nutrition in aquatic animals. Genomics and transcriptomics reveal genetic responses of aquatic animals to nutritional interventions, while proteomics and metabolomics enable large-scale analysis of proteins and metabolites, illuminating physiological changes under various nutritional conditions. Moreover, microbiomics provides crucial insights into the interactions between gut microbiota and host nutrient metabolism and immunity. Key applications such as gene editing and protein post-translational modification analysis further elucidate molecular mechanisms of nutritional regulation in fish. Despite significant advances, omics still faces persistent challenges, including technological complexity, ethical concerns, underdeveloped regulatory systems, ecological safety risks, and issues related to data storage and sharing. Addressing these through technological innovation, improved regulatory frameworks, and the expansion of application areas will be crucial for the sustainable advancement of omics in aquatic animal nutrition research.",

But beyond stating the necessity of laminin, organoid-laminin interactions have gone largely unstudied, as this ubiquitous requirement of exogenous laminin hinders investigation. In this work, a fast stress relaxing, boronate ester-based synthetic hydrogel is used for the culture of intestinal organoids, and it is fortuitously discovered that unlike all other synthetic hydrogels to date, laminin does not need to be supplemented for crypt formation. This highly defined material provides a unique opportunity to investigate laminin-organoid interactions and how it influences crypt evolution and organoid function. Via fluorescent labeling of non-canonical amino acids, it is further shown that adaptable boronate ester bonds increase deposition of nascent proteins, including laminin. Collectively, these results advance the understanding of how mechanical and matricellular signaling influence intestinal organoid development.",

Untargeted lipidomics identified 35 lipid subclasses, revealing triacylglyceride (65.91%) as the core lipid. A comparative analysis with commercial oil uncovered 287 significantly different lipid species and signature interfacial phospholipids, PA (33:0), PS (38:4), and PC (34:2). Unsaturated fatty acids, accounting for 82.49% of the total composition, enhanced interfacial membrane fluidity, while abundant bioactive components such as vitamin E (19.2 mg/100 g), γ-oryzanol (0.67%), and sterols (1153 mg/100 g) conferred oxidative stability. The predominance of hydrophilic amino acids facilitates colloidal stability and digestibility. Dominant interfacial proteins oleosin 16 and oleosin 18 kDa feature tripartite structural domains and demonstrated spontaneous C-terminal binding to PA/PS/PC via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, forming a stable interfacial structure.

The NCOR/HDAC3 complex is large and multi-component, including the transducin beta-like 1 (TBL1) and TBL1-related 1 (TBLR1) proteins. Loss of TBL1 in the hepatocytes and TBLR1 in the white adipocytes has been shown to impair fasting- and β-adrenergic-induced lipolysis. However, their roles in BAT thermogenesis remain unknown. Here, we report that deletion of TBLR1 alone in brown adipocytes does not impair the adaptive thermogenic response to prolonged cold exposure. In contrast, simultaneous deletion of TBL1 and TBLR1 dampens β-adrenergic-induced lipolysis and mitochondrial respiration in cultured mouse brown adipocytes. Transgenic mice with UCP1-Cre mediated double deletion of TBLR1 and TBL1 exhibit reduced whole-body energy expenditure during prolonged cold exposure, lower core body temperature, increased appearance of unilocular adipocytes in BAT, and suppressed expression of metabolic and myogenic PRDM16 target genes. Also, we present some evidence that TBLR1 and TBL1 interact with HDAC3 and PRDM16 in brown adipocytes, potentially suggesting a direct involvement in the PRDM16-controlled transcriptional program.

Although both JunD and miR-206 are critically involved in muscle development, their specific roles in yak skeletal muscle ontogeny remain poorly characterized, particularly regarding the regulatory axis involving miR-206-mediated targeting of JunD during myoblast proliferation and differentiation. To address this knowledge gap, this study used methods such as CCK-8, EdU, RT-qPCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, and the dual-luciferase reporter system. It was found that JunD significantly promoted the expression of cell cycle factors, such as CDK2 and PCNA, and increased cell proliferation and the proportion of S-phase cells. JunD overexpression or interference experiments demonstrated that it enhanced the differentiation and myotube formation ability of myoblasts and simultaneously upregulated the expression of key genes such as MYOG and MYOD. Additionally, the results of cell cycle detection by flow cytometry revealed that the JunD gene inhibited the apoptosis of yak myoblasts. Transcriptome analysis revealed that JunD regulated cAMP and other signaling pathways related to proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The results of the dual-luciferase reporter assay showed a good binding relationship between miR-206 and JunD. The rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-206 regulated the expression of the JunD gene, thereby exerting its influence at the transcriptional level. This study marks the first identification of JunD in yaks and clarifies its role in the development of yak myoblasts through the miR-206-JunD regulatory axis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular breeding of cattle, contributing to the basic research into the breeding and muscle development of yaks.",

Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of genes for metabolic enzymes and cytokines. However, the molecular mechanisms of PPARs on vascular physiology are not fully evaluated. Our objective was to assess the association between the expression of PPARs in ex vivo aortic tissue ant the gene expression of markers of arterial remodeling and inflammation.\n\nTwo aortic tissue samples were obtained from 20 patients [mean age 69 years, standard deviation (SD) 5] who underwent open AAA repair. One from the aneurysmal sac and other from nondiseased adjacent aortic tissue. Four micrometers (μm) sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson for histopathologic evaluation and arterial wall thickness morphometry. Total Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and retrotranscribed to determine PPARs, matrix remodeling proteins and cytokine gene expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific forward and reverse oligonucleotides and SybrGreen master mix. Statistical analysis was conducted using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test in Prism 8 for Mac (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nAneurysm biopsies demonstrated loss of smooth muscle cells, and fragmented and disorganized elastic fibers and changes in extracellular matrix composition. The expression of PPARα, PPARδ and PPARγ was significantly lower in the aneurysmal aorta compared to nondiseased control tissue from the same patients (59%, 61% and 42% respectively, p<0.01). The expression of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP4 was significantly reduced in the aneurysmal tissue compared to control (64%), while that of the ECM-degrading enzyme cathepsin S was 7-fold higher in the aneurysmal aortic tissue (p<0.01). Gene expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and the cytokines TNFα and IL-1β was significantly upregulated in aneurysmal tissue compared to control nondiseased tissue (20-fold, 83-fold and 18-fold, respectively, p<0.001).\n\nThese results confirm an inverse correlation between PPARs gene expression and inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, along with an unfavorable arterial remodeling gene expression. The decrease in the expression of the three PPAR isoforms in the aortic tissue appears to promote abnormal arterial remodeling and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to wall thinning and AAA progression.",

It also functions as an inflammatory mediator and triggers caspase-3, which causes brain damage. The purpose of this study was to unveil the phytochemical richness of macadamia nut oil (MO) and assess its potential as a treatment for brain damage caused by potassium dichromate (PDC), as well as its impact on galectin-3/caspase-3 and Sitruin1. The active ingredients of MO were determined by thorough analyses using GC-MS, HPLC, and spectrophotometry. These included oleic acid (47.53 %), palmitoleic acid (16.48 %), squalene, β-sitosterol, seven phenolic compounds (catechol being the most prevalent), and vital vitamins, particularly vitamin K (11.07 mg/ml). Both saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions of MO demonstrate strong antioxidant qualities, efficiently scavenging DPPH and ABTS radicals. By restoring Nrf2 and SIRT1 levels and reducing keap1, MAPK, ERK, galectin-3, and caspase-3 levels in the brain, the oil successfully mitigated PDC-induced brain damage. Furthermore, MO significantly reduced the immune-expression of caspase-3 and GFAP in the cerebellar cortex. These discoveries establish MO as a potent natural neuroprotective agent, paving the way for novel pharmaceutical approaches to treat neurodegenerative illnesses and improve brain function. Moreover, this study establishes a viable path for improving cognitive wellness and promoting general neurological health by creating functional meals and nutritional supplements enhanced with this beneficial oil.",

Mechanistic studies showed that FG exhibited unique structural compatibility with SA, driven by strong electrostatic interactions (ΔH = -6.59 kJ/mol, ΔS = 5.9 J/(mol·K)) and conformational flexibility from its linear polypeptide backbone. SA increased FG's emulsifying activity (EAI) by 108.7 % and stability (ESI) by 53-fold, outperforming SPI (31.4 % EAI increase) and WPI (21.3 % EAI increase). The constructed FG-SA composite emulsion system exhibited excellent overall performance, characterized by a uniform droplet size distribution (3.11 μm - 5.53 μm), markedly improved storage stability (> 7 d), and ideal rheological properties and water retention capacity.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the wheat bZIP transcription factor TabZIP156 plays a vital role in enhancing drought tolerance. However, the drought tolerance mechanism of TabZIP156 in wheat remains unclear. In this study, TaJAZ3-2 A was identified as an interactor of TabZIP156 through yeast two-hybrid screening. This interaction was confirmed in vivo using luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and further validated in vitro by GST pull-down experiments. The LCI assays showed that the C-terminal domain of TabZIP156 interacted with the N-terminal domain of TaJAZ3-2 A. Transcription level analysis revealed that TaJAZ3-2 A was predominantly expressed in roots, and exhibited significant response to PEG-induced drought, ABA, and MeJA stress. Subcellular localization analysis showed that TaJAZ3-2 A was localized to the nucleus. Functional studies revealed that TaJAZ3-2 A overexpressing Arabidopsis displayed reduced drought tolerance. Conversely, virus-induced gene silencing of TaJAZ3-2 A in wheat showed enhanced drought tolerance and upregulated key stress-responsive and antioxidant-related genes. Moreover, the dual-luciferase assays showed that TaJAZ3-2 A and TabZIP156 mutually antagonize each other in regulating the expression levels of TaP5CS, TaDREB1A, and TaPOD. In conclusion, these findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of TabZIP156 in wheat drought tolerance and establish a theoretical foundation for the development of drought-tolerant wheat cultivars.",

In this study, we investigated the associations between insulin resistance (IR) during the transition period and the occurrence of CYTO. We measured insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue gene expression on d -21 and d 21 and a selection of blood metabolites weekly from d -21 to d 42 relative to calving of 39 Holstein dairy cows. Study groups were formed based on the CYTO status on d 42. Our findings indicate that cows with CYTO had a greater insulin response to a glucose infusion prepartum, suggesting a link between prepartum IR and the development of CYTO. Postpartum, CYTO cows showed lower insulin and higher nonesterified fatty acids concentrations in plasma. Additionally, CYTO cows showed altered gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue, with increased mRNA levels of hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) and insulin receptor (INSR), and a tendency for higher glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein levels. These results suggest that metabolic stress and IR are interconnected, contributing to the development of CYTO. The study underscores the importance of managing metabolic health before calving to prevent CYTO and improve reproductive performance in dairy cows.",

Twelve multiparous Nordic Red cows were used in a cyclic change-over study with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. The cows were divided into block 1 (DIM 151 ± 12.7 d, milk yield 29.7 ± 4.08 kg/d) and block 2 (DIM 115 ± 15.1 d, milk yield 39.5 ± 3.45 kg/d). The study consisted of three 17-d periods with an 18-d washout between periods. Cows were randomly assigned to treatments which included rapeseed cake (RSC) or pea (MFP) as protein feed without (CON) or with seaweed supplementation (Ascophyllum nodosum [AN; 57 g DM/d] or Laminaria digitata [LD; 7.8 g DM/d]). Cows were offered a concentrate mix of seaweed, sugar beet pulp, mineral supplement, and molasses, and ad libitum partial mixed ration consisting of grass silage, barley, and protein feed. Diets had I concentration (mg/kg DM) of 4.1 for RSC-CON, 6.8 for RSC-AN and RSC-LD, 1.9 for MFP-CON, and 4.7 for MFP-AN and MFP-LD. Despite decreased I intake, I transfer efficiency and concentration in milk were increased when rapeseed was substituted with pea. Seaweeds increased the intake, transfer efficiency, and milk concentration of I. Seaweeds increased the intake of As, but highly toxic trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb) were not found in milk on any treatment. Milk I concentration was very low, especially in RSC-CON (38 µg/kg), possibly due to the unexpectedly high glucosinolate concentration (48 mmol/kg DM) of rapeseed. Milk I concentration on MFP-CON and I transfer efficiency on all pea diets were also lower than usual. In conclusion, pea diets resulted in more favorable milk I concentration for human consumers than rapeseed high in glucosinolates.",

Based on the dielectric spectrum, detection models were constructed using partial least squares (PLS), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, and an optimized CNN-LSTM fused with the crested porcupine optimizer (CPO) and squeeze-and-excitation network (CPO-CNN-LSTM-SEN) for camel milk quality detection.

In this study, we investigated the functional role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Membrane-Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 5 (MARCH5) in regulating cell growth, metabolic reprogramming and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM) through the negative regulation of the mitochondrial fusion driver mitofusin 2 (MFN2).\n\nCell viability and apoptosis were evaluated in MM cell lines or in co-culture with stromal cells using the CellTiter-Glo® Cell Viability Assay and Annexin V/7-AAD staining, respectively. Clonogenic potential was assessed using methylcellulose-based colony formation assays. Protein stability was determined via cycloheximide chase experiments, while protein-protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Oxygen consumption was measured using high-resolution respirometry in live cells. Transcriptomic profiling was performed using the Illumina NGS platform, and mRNA and protein levels were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. In vivo anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated in NOD-SCID mice subcutaneously engrafted with MM cells, using an MFN2-inducible model or following intraperitoneal administration of leflunomide. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze tumor xenografts and mouse organs.\n\nKnockdown of MARCH5 led to a pronounced elongation of mitochondria accompanied by increased expression of MFN2, likely resulting from reduced MARCH5-mediated ubiquitylation. Functionally, silencing MARCH5 impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and reduced ATP production, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in MM cells. Notably, similar phenotypic and functional effects were observed following either genetic overexpression or pharmacological activation of MFN2 using leflunomide, both in vitro and in vivo in a murine xenograft model of MM. Transcriptomic profiling of MARCH5-depleted cells revealed downregulation of gene sets associated with mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthesis, pathways implicated in the development of venetoclax resistance. Consistently, both MARCH5 knockdown and MFN2 upregulation enhanced the sensitivity of MM cells to venetoclax.\n\nShifting mitochondrial dynamics toward fusion by targeting the MARCH5-MFN2 axis impairs ETC and OXPHOS, thereby sensitizing MM cells to venetoclax.

It is characterised by onset of cardiac structural and functional impairments and can lead to direct development of clinical heart failure (HF) or predispose to hypertensive/ischaemic stress. DbCM is a complex disease which involves several metabolic and pathogenic factors. We characterised an established high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced DbCM model incorporating typical features of human disease to determine its suitability for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutics prior to advancement to human trials. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomised to HFD and single-dose STZ (100 mg/kg) or control diet (CD) and vehicle. HFD/STZ mice developed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), reflected by high fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels, reduced β-cell function, and increased insulin resistance without systolic blood pressure alteration. Furthermore, HFD/STZ mice displayed progressive diastolic dysfunction, evidenced by decreased MV E/A ratio, together with elevated chronic left ventricular (LV) filling pressure parameters, measured by left atrial (LA) area and LA volume, compared to controls, in parallel with LV hypertrophy and fibrosis. Monocyte trafficking into diabetic hearts was identified by single-nuclei RNA sequencing analysis, which revealed an interferon-α response in DbCM mice, whilst plasma proteomics confirmed the involvement of inflammatory processes with elevated plasma C-reactive protein in DbCM progression. Taken together, our HFD/STZ-induced DbCM model exhibits a unique DbCM pre-clinical phenotype reflecting a \"triple-hit\" of human DbCM features comprising (1) T2DM with insulin resistance, (2) progressive diastolic dysfunction and LV remodelling, and (3) metabolic inflammation.

Though essential for cardiovascular homeostasis, the effects of SIRT6-mediated lysine myristoylation on CVDs progression remain largely unexplored due to detection limitations. This study developes an innovative lysine-myristoylated peptide enrichment technique, identifying mutant SIRT6 (H133Y) with high myristoyl affinity but deficient demyristoylase activity. This advancement enables identification of 15 previously unrecognized human lysine-myristoylated proteins. Further study demonstrates that SIRT6 demyristoylates activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) at K296 and regulates its nucleoplasmic translocation. Through 4D label-free mass spectrometry and molecular approaches, it is revealed that decreased nuclear localization of ATF2 results in reduced Protein kinase C delta type (PRKCD) expression, establishing a SIRT6/Myr-ATF2/PRKCD/VE-Cadherin pathway that enhances endothelial barrier integrity under high myristate conditions. These findings are validated in vitro (gene overexpression/knockdown cells) and in vivo (SIRT6 knockout/double-transgenic mice). The study provides both a novel method for identifying lysine-myristoylated proteins and critical insights into SIRT6 demyristoylation biology.

Here, a critical role of LGR4 is demonstrated in islet β cell mass using a group of transgenic mice with LGR4 deficiency. Knock-out of Lgr4 in the pancreas and islet β cells significantly reduced islet β cell mass, and subsequently impaired glucose metabolism upon the challenge of a high-fat diet. Deficiency of LGR4 in these mice or in cultured INS-1 cells showed a significant reduction in islet β cell proliferation measured by Ki-67, EdU, and CCK-8 assay. Increase of islet β cell proliferation induced by Rspondin-LGR4 signaling occurred via Wnt-β-catenin-Ccnd1 axis. In addition, the deficiency of LGR4 in islet β cells significantly increased apoptosis. Inhibition of RANKL-RANK signaling by the TRAF-STOP inhibitor significantly attenuated apoptosis of cultured INS-1 cells induced by deficiency of LGR4. Overall, this work shows that deficiency of LGR4 reduces islet β cell mass via suppression of proliferation and concurrent increase of apoptosis. LGR4 in pancreatic islets is thus critical for the control of glucose homeostasis.",

APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor TARGET OF EAT3 (TOE3) plays a pivotal role in plant antiviral immunity. However, little is known about the impact of PTMs on TOE3 function. Here, that casein kinase II α subunit-like protein (CK2αL) is identified to interact with TOE3, phosphorylating it at serine 58 (S58) and threonine 128 (T128). Overexpression of CK2αL enhances the stability of TOE3 to upregulate the expression of defense-related genes, thereby improving tobacco resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Additionally, the F-box protein FBXL1 interacts with TOE3 and promotes the ubiquitination-degradation of TOE3 through the 26S proteasome, and overexpression of FBXL1 facilitates TMV infection in tobacco. Importantly, CK2αL-phosphorylated TOE3 exhibits a lower binding affinity to FBXL1 compared to the nonphosphorylated TOE3, thereby protecting TOE3 from FBXL1-mediated degradation by the 26S proteasome. The stable TOE3 activates the expression of defense-related genes to enhance the resistance of plants to viral infection. Taken together, the findings demonstrate a mechanism by which phosphorylation and ubiquitination cooperatively regulate the stability of TOE3 to fine-tune antiviral immunity in tobacco.",

Compared with those from deeper waters, the fish from upper layers presented greater MP abundances and smaller average sizes. A significant negative correlation was detected between the abundance of MPs in fish and their length and weight. The global per capita MP consumption from captured fish, including all tissues and muscles, is approximately 5.60 × 10",

    "combined_text": "RSV infection disrupts gut microbiota and metabolic homeostasis in mice, regulating pulmonary inflammation via the SPHK/S1P pathway.\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary pathogen for lower respiratory tract infections in children, posing a significant health threat. However, the systemic effects of RSV, particularly on gut microbiota and immune regulation along the gut-lung axis, are not well understood. We utilized a mouse model of RSV infection and assessed dynamic changes in the gut microbiome via high-throughput sequencing. We also investigated the interplay between pulmonary inflammation and gut microbiota, as well as their metabolites, through metabolomics analysis. RSV infection did not substantially alter the gut microbiota's alpha diversity but modified the relative abundance of specific phyla and genera. Notably, there was an increase in taxa such as Bacteroidetes and Veillonella, which may be linked to inflammation. Concurrently, sphingolipid components, including sphingomyelin, sphingosine, and ceramide, were significantly reduced in RSV-infected mice, correlating with increased pulmonary sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) protein expression. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated the potential of sphingolipids as biomarkers for distinguishing healthy from RSV-infected states. Inhibition of the S1P metabolic pathway, using sphingosine kinase (SPHK) and S1P inhibitors, reduced S1P expression and pulmonary inflammation, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Dietary changes, notably a low-fat diet, ameliorated lung inflammation and neutrophil accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, highlighting the role of dietary intervention in managing RSV infection. Immunophenotyping revealed the effects of SPHK and S1P inhibitors on lymphocyte subpopulations, foreshadowing their roles in modulating immune responses. These findings offer novel insights into how RSV infection modulates pulmonary inflammation by altering gut microbiota and metabolic pathways, providing a basis for new therapeutic strategies.\n\nOur research provides new insights into how respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection affects the host's gut microbiota, lipid metabolism, and the immune-inflammatory network. The findings demonstrate that dietary modulation and pharmacological intervention of the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway can mitigate inflammation caused by RSV infection, presenting potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat RSV infections.",

Long-term consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet not only leads to metabolic disruptions in the body but also disturbs brain homeostasis, particularly affecting the amygdala, a key region involved in regulating depression.\n\nThis study explored the therapeutic potential of geniposide, a bioactive iridoid glycoside known for its antiinflammatory properties, in mitigating HF diet-induced depressive behaviors and amygdala pathology.\n\nGeniposide supplementation significantly improved HF diet-induced depression, as assessed through various behavioral tests including the open field test, forced swimming test, elevated plus maze test, and tail suspension test. Geniposide demonstrated notable synaptic protective effects, evidenced by an increase in the length of the active zone and postsynaptic density thickness, as well as a decrease in the synaptic cleft in the amygdala of HF diet-fed mice. Additionally, geniposide suppressed microglial activation, downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-6], and reduced C3/C1q expression. Furthermore, geniposide administration markedly decreased the colocalization of C1q, a microglia-derived complement component, with postsynaptic density protein 95-positive puncta in the amygdala.\n\nIn summary, this study demonstrates that geniposide alleviates HF diet-induced depressive behaviors, which is associated with improved synaptic health and reduced neuroinflammation in the amygdala. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the potential repurposing of geniposide in the management of obesity-related affective disorders.",

Effective therapeutic strategies are limited, and resistance to treatment is a major obstacle. Myeloid Cell Leukemia (MCL)-1 and B-cell leukemia (BCL)-xL are anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that block cell-intrinsic apoptosis through interactions on the mitochondrial outer membrane which contribute to therapeutic resistance. We investigated whether B-cell homology domain (BH)-3 profiles were consistent between intra-patient fresh tumor sample, patient-derived cells (PDC), and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) by BH3 profiling; we observed striking consistency which enabled cross model comparisons. Next, we co-targeted BCL-xl and MCL-1 and noted that the combination synergistically reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, BCL-xL inhibition affected the cells through both the canonical and the emerging non-canonical apoptotic pathways. BCL-xL induced mitochondrial depolarization which resulted in MCL-1 cellular dependency rendering cells highly sensitive to MCL-1 inhibition. Next, we co-targeted BCL-xL and MCL-1 in vivo which induced synthetic lethality in PDX models within hours, implying that this approach is not a safe strategy for clinical development. However, targeting MCL-1, which exerts its anti-apoptotic activity without non-apoptotic on-target effects, decreased the mitochondrial threshold for apoptosis and enhanced chemosensitivity without toxicity in PDX models. Our findings suggest that targeting the mitochondria via MCL-1 enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy but co-targeting two proteins in the Bcl-2 pathways results in synergistic lethality. These results will help define a safe clinical strategy to utilize Bcl-2 targeted therapy to undermine therapeutic resistance in patients with DM.",

Camel milk is abundant in bioactive compounds such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, and immunoglobulins, while also displaying low allergenicity, which provides an inherent advantage for functional particle preparation. Its unique nutritional profile and limited availability make it a promising resource for developing highly valuable nanoparticles (NPs). This study used camel milk as the fermentation substrate, Lactiplantibacillus paraplantarum (L. paraplantarum) LR-1 as the fermentation strain, and ultrasonic treatment for PPNP preparation. Throughout the fermentation process, the metabolic activity of the lactic acid bacteria facilitated protein-polysaccharide binding, improving the particle size, stability, and antioxidant capacity. Ultrasonic treatment further optimized the particle morphology and enhanced interfacial adsorption at the oil-water interface. The particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), contact angle analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and ζ-potential measurements. UV spectroscopy, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and in vitro antioxidant assays were also performed. The results indicated that the PPNPs exposed to ultrasonic treatment for 11 min exhibited superior antioxidant activity and stability, with particle sizes that complied with food-grade NP standards.

The present study aimed to elucidate the evolutionary history and physiological functions of TRP genes (TRPs) in E. sinensis through a combination of phylogenetic analyses and transcriptomic approaches. The evolutionary analysis revealed a significant expansion of the TRPA subfamily in arthropods. Sequence analysis and codon usage bias assessment further indicated that TRPs exhibit a certain degree of conservation between E. sinensis and its closely related species, suggesting they are likely subject to evolutionary selective pressures. To investigate the physiological roles of TRPs in E. sinensis, we conducted transcriptomic analysis of TRPs across different tissues, molting stages of the hepatopancreas, and ovarian developmental stages. The results showed that TRPA genes were highly expressed in the gills, hindgut, and midgut, suggesting a potential involvement in immune response. The significant overexpression of TRP and TRPL in the eyestalk implied their possible role in phototransduction. High expression of TRPs was observed in the hepatopancreas during various molting stages. Additionally, TRPC genes were highly expressed at different ovarian developmental stages. Overall, this study revealed the evolutionary dynamics of TRPs in E. sinensis and provided preliminary evidence for their potential regulatory roles in tissue function, molting, and ovarian maturation, with further experimental validation required in the future.",

Generalized linear regression was applied to examine the associations of whole blood lead and cadmium with cardiac-specific biomarkers, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The potential pathways underpinning the associations with mortality were explored using mediation analyses.\n\nA total of 11,193 participants were included, and nearly 93.9% of individuals had lead levels below the World Health Organization guidelines for the clinical management of lead (5 μg/dL). Lead and cadmium levels were positively associated with metrics of myocardial injury (high-sensitivity troponin T and I), myocardial stress (N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]), inflammation and oxidative stress (C-reactive protein, total homocysteine, methylmalonic acid), and mortality risks. Significant increases of 2.23% in high-sensitivity troponin T and 7.05% in NT-proBNP were associated with per SD increase in lead levels. The higher troponin and NT-proBNP levels may mediate up to 33.10% of the associations of cardiovascular mortality with lead and cadmium, and the associations were greater in older participants and those who had diabetes and hypertension.\n\nOur results suggest that the associations of low-level lead and cadmium exposures with mortality risks may be potentially mediated by worsening myocardial injury and stress.",

It is well-established that interventions encompassing resistance training alone or in combination with whey protein supplementation, referred to hereafter as muscle-building interventions, are effective for increasing muscle mass and function in the elderly population. However, the impact of these muscle-building interventions on glucose metabolism in elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity remains unclear. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of muscle-building interventions on blood glucose and insulin resistance in elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity.\n\nThe muscle-building interventions in this study included resistance training alone and resistance training combined with whey protein supplementation. In this randomized controlled trial, elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity were divided into three distinct groups: the control group, the resistance training group, and the resistance training combined with whey protein supplement group. The muscle-building interventions were conducted for 12 weeks.\n\nImplementing muscle-building interventions showed significant improvements in glycemic indices (HbA1c, OGTT 2-hour plasma glucose) and insulin resistance levels (HOMA-IR, Gutt index) for elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity. These muscle-building interventions enhanced muscle functional indices (handgrip strength, 5-time chair stand test). The combination of resistance training with whey protein supplementation did not significantly enhance the favorable effects on glucose metabolism compared to resistance exercise alone. Correlation analyses revealed that improvements in muscle strength were significantly associated with enhancements in glucose metabolism.\n\nIn elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity, muscle-building interventions (particularly resistance exercise) have been shown to significantly improve blood glucose control and insulin resistance.",

Yaghooti grape in addition to its good flavor, is highly regarded by consumers due to its high nutritional value. However, the compact clusters and small berries are notable features that negatively impact its marketability. Gibberellin is widely used to reduce cluster density. This research aimed to identify lncRNAs involved in cluster formation and examine how their expression is influenced by gibberellin treatment. The expression of lncRNAs is spatiotemporally specific, and external stimuli can influence their expression. However, the role of lncRNA in modulating the transcriptional pathway of gibberellin is unknown. The length of grape clusters increased from 107 to 184 mm under gibberellin treatment, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in cluster density. RNA-seq data related to Sistan Yaghooti grape clusters were examined at three stages of formation and in response to gibberellin to identify lncRNA transcripts. A total of 2021 lncRNAs were identified, of which 262 lncRNAs showed differential expression. The numbers of lncRNAs and target genes that exhibited significant differential expression were 76, 100, and 86 lncRNAs and 146, 143, and 138 target genes, respectively, in stage2 vs. stage1, stage3 vs. stage2, and stage3 vs. stage1. The target genes of lncRNAs were significantly associated with (Catabolic Process, hydrolase activity, Phosphorylation, ATP binding, response to abiotic stimulus). Furthermore, pathway analysis indicated that majority of genes in the treated samples were primarily linked to metabolic pathways and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in comparison to the control group. Specifically, genes such as cytokinin (CK), Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), squamosa-promoter binding protein-like2 (SPL2), LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD), Domain of Unknown Function 1218 (DUF1218), the non-specific phospholipase C2 (NPC2), Cytochrome P450 (P450 CYP), pectin methylesterases (PMEs), and AGAMOUS (AG) showed significantly increased expression in response to gibberellin. Some of these genes are targets of lncRNAs that interact with microRNAs (miRNAs) vvi-miR156, vvi-miR159, vvi-miR172, and vvi-miR319. Among the differentially expressed non-coding RNAs, lncRNA LOC100257036 and vvi-miR156 may contribute to gibberellin-mediated regulation of AG, potentially influencing cluster architecture through a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathway.",

Key processes include gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism and urea formation, bile acid synthesis, detoxification, endocrine functions, and immune functions. Various tests have been used to assess liver function. Fatty liver develops when fatty acid uptake exceeds the liver's capacity to oxidize fatty acids and export triacylglycerols and may negatively affect hepatic function. Metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics are opening new insights into hepatic adaptations in normal and abnormal situations, such as the roles of acylcarnitines, lysophospholipids, and sphingolipids. Nutritional strategies such as controlled energy dry cow diets and supplemental rumen-protected methionine and choline help maintain liver function during the periparturient period.

It is believed that the RAS plays a central role in stress-induced hepatic programming. To determine the effects of prenatal stress, sex, and age on hepatic RAS of the offspring, pregnant Wistar rats were divided into control and stress groups. The unpredictable stress protocol was performed in the last week of pregnancy. The offspring were divided according to sex, age, and intervention. At 90 and 120 days, the offspring´s blood and liver were collected to measure hepatic enzyme activity, isoprostane levels, and protein expression of the RAS and redox balance. At 90 days old, stress similarly reduced NOX4 in both sexes, while NOX2, NOX2/NOX4 ratio, and isoprostane were increased only in female offspring. Stress responses of NOX2 were still higher in females when compared to males. At 120 days, prenatal stress increased the activity of AST and ALT in females, while decreasing AST in males. Furthermore, stress enhances the expression of AT1R, ACE, and MasR in males, while reducing NOX2/NOX4 ratio. Still, stress reduced ACE2 expression and continued to increase NOX2/NOX4 ratio in females at 120 days. Prenatal stress induces hepatic programming in offspring in a sex- and age-specific way, altering the RAS and NOX4 pathways at 120-day-old males while inducing early redox changes in females at 90 days and remaining at 120 days.",

Attaining nutrition targets in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is challenging, with suboptimal nutrition associated with poor outcomes. Modification of oral and enteral feeds, via supplementation or substitution with concentrated formula, to increase energy and protein provision is a common strategy utilized to address these gaps. However, there is limited literature and no expert consensus to guide this practice. We conducted a scoping review following JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) methodology of all English-language studies (excluding reviews) exploring feed modification in the PICU in children aged up to 5 years published between 2010 and January 4, 2025. Of 2696 studies screened, 14 were included, with 57% (n = 8) published since 2020. Ten (71%) studies were randomized controlled trials and 8 (80%) of these explored congenital heart disease. Interventions comprised concentrated infant formula powder (n = 3; 30%), ready-to-feed liquid formula (n = 3; 30%), and expressed breast milk (n = 2; 20%). Primary outcomes varied with nutritional intake-related (n = 5; 50%) measures most frequently utilized. No consistent terminology was used to refer to \"feed modification\". Tolerance, ease of preparation, and contamination risk were identified as important considerations. In conclusion, a variety of techniques were used, with no consistent definitions, and the randomized trials were inconsistent in methodology and did not measure patient-centered outcomes. Further research is required to reach consensus for practice guidelines following further establishment of methods of feed modification that address nutrition gaps and improve patient outcomes.",

Rich with diverse bioactive elements, rice bran serves as a nontraditional functional food ingredient with health promoting attributes. The nutritional profile of rice bran compared to those of other cereal grains is inclusive of energy-providing carbohydrates, essential vitamins and minerals, and amino and fatty acids, as well as unique phytochemicals. The composition of rice bran consists of an array of phytosterols, prebiotics, tocotrienols, tocopherols, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds that contribute antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. A unique rice bran compound is γ-oryzanol, which is widely recognized for supporting the immune system, regulating blood lipids, and protecting against some types of cancer. In this review we have summarized the multifaceted potential of rice bran for reducing diarrhea and controlling diabetes and cardiometabolic disease, as well as preventing or controlling progression of cancer. Rice bran-mediated regulation of bowel function through prebiotics and soluble and insoluble fiber acts synergistically in lowering gut inflammation through microbiota and regulating the metabolism of lipids and proteins that are important for health. The capacity of rice bran to enhance nutritional status in connection with the prevention and management of chronic diseases merits greater attention in the food product marketplace.

Here, the inorganic Se bioconcentration was employed to generate Se-enriched Akkermansia muciniphila (Se-AM), and we investigated its Se distribution, selenoprotein and selenoamino acid species, essential elements, and amino acid contents. Furthermore, the major probiotic properties of Se-AM were evaluated. The results showed that the Se-AM exhibited remarkable survival and Se enrichment levels. The organic Se content in Se-AM accounted for approximately 81.9%, predominantly composed of protein bound Se (44.3%), followed by nucleic acid bound Se (17.8%) and polysaccharide bound Se (17.4%). The Se element in Se-AM exhibits a preference for binding to proteins with medium molecular weight, predominantly forming selenoamino acids containing SeCys2 and SeMet. Moreover, the content of both individual and total amino acids is higher in Se-AM compared to AM. Furthermore, Se-AM demonstrates robust acid resistance and antioxidant activity along with enhanced adhesion to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. It also possesses immune-stimulating properties by activating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in Raw 264.7 cells, leading to increased cytokine release. Transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated expression levels of key genes associated with potent antioxidants, strong cellular adhesion capabilities, and effective cancer cell eradication within Se-AM when compared to AM. Our findings indicated that the Se-AM holds promising potential as a novel probiotic formulation supplemented with Se for both its Se-enhancing properties and probiotic functionality.",

Spirulina grows well in highly alkaline environments with a pH range of 9.5–11 such as pond, fresh and marine water. It is an excellent source of proteins, vitamins (ascorbic acid, tocopherol, and B-complex), minerals (iron and magnesium), and fatty acids (gamma linoleic acid, capric acid, palmitic acid, omega-3 and omega-6). It has a higher essential amino acid profiles than soybean meal, which usually is the main protein source in poultry diets. In addition, spirulina contains phytopigments (carotenoids and phycocyanins) and bioactive compounds (polyphenols and flavonoinds), which have a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, hypolipidemic, hypocholesterolemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. There has been variable results on growth-promoting effects of spirulina in broilers. Knowledge and detailed understanding of spirulina’s nutritional composition, (i.e., proximate, amino acid, vitamins, minerals, and fatty acid), mechanisms of action, and its supplementation value in broilers are critical to fully maximize its use in broiler nutrition. However, while most of these findings are valuable, they are scattered throughout the literature, making it difficult to use them in evidence-based decision-making in the poultry industry. The present review therefore attempts to pool current published evidence on spirulina’s chemical composition, and the effect of its supplementation on production indices and health status of broilers to enhance the adoption of these findings in decision support system in the poultry industry, as well as to identify knowledge gaps and fashion out new research directions.

Significant linear and quadratic dose-responses were detected for multiple parameters: feed conversion ratio, hepatosomatic index, viscerosomatic index, glycogen content, amylase and protease activities, and hepatic antioxidant status. The 0.5% SUA supplementation group demonstrated enhanced intestinal morphology, upregulated expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and Claudin-4) and antiapoptotic Bcl2, increased abundance of beneficial microbiota and suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (GRP78, PERK, IRE1, ATF6, eIF2α, and Chopα). Additionally, dietary 0.5% SUA upregulated hepatic anti-inflammatory mediators (Nrf2, TGFβ1, and IL10), glycolytic genes (PK, PFKL2, and GK), β-oxidation-related CPT1, antiapoptotic Bag, and glucose transporter GLUT2, while downregulating proinflammatory TNFα, gluconeogenic enzymes (PEPCK and G6Pase), lipogenic genes (ACC1 and FASN), and proapoptotic Bad. Broken-line regression analysis identified 0.46-0.50% as the optimal SUA inclusion level based on growth parameters. This study demonstrates that appropriate SUA supplementation alleviates HSD-induced oxidative stress, enhances intestinal barrier function, modulates gut microbiota, and maintains metabolic homeostasis, thereby improving starch utilization and growth performance.",

Bovine lactoferrin (bLF) possesses immune-regulating and nutritional properties; however, the impact of probiotics on bLF remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether probiotics can enhance the synthesis and secretion of bLF in the mammary gland, with a particular focus on the specific mechanisms by which Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) regulates bLF. Primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) were cultured in six-well plates and treated with various types of probiotics. The expression of bLF was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of transcription factors associated with the bLF promoter region, specifically, was analyzed through qRT-PCR and Western blot. Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus), Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus), Bifidobacterium (Bifido.), and L. plantarum upregulated bLF gene and protein expression to varying extents, with L. plantarum exhibiting the most pronounced effect. Furthermore, L. plantarum was found to regulate the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 and AP-1. These findings indicate that probiotics can influence the expression of bLF in mammary gland tissue. Additionally, L. plantarum modulates the production of bLF via the STAT3 and AP-1 transcription factor pathways.",

Sertoli cells orchestrate testicular immune responses during orchitis by modulating local inflammation and maintaining blood-testis barrier integrity. While Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), a critical adaptor molecule in the TLR4 signaling pathway, is known to mediate immune responses, its cell-specific role in Sertoli cells during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced orchitis remains elusive. Using an murine orchitis model established through intraperitoneal LPS administration, we observed pronounced testicular inflammation concurrent with dramatic upregulation of MyD88 protein levels (P < 0.05). To further investigate the Sertoli cell-specific function of MyD88, we generated conditional Myd88 knockout (cKO) mice. Compared to controls, cKO mice showed marked attenuation of testicular edema along with improved sperm motility and viability post-LPS challenge. Myd88 deletion also suppressed LPS-triggered surges in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), maintained seminiferous tubule architecture, and mitigated neutrophil infiltration. Further studies demonstrated that Myd88 deletion rescued LPS-induced BTB disruption by restoring the expression of key BTB components (Connexin43, Claudin-11). Additionally, NF-κB signaling pathway is activated by MyD88 mediated inflammatory responses. Collectively, these findings uncover Sertoli cell specific MyD88 as a key regulator in LPS-induced orchitis pathogenesis, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic target for orchitis.",

Black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) is gaining importance due to its high protein content with a well-balanced amino acid profile. A 90-day triplicate feeding trial was executed to evaluate the impact of partial and complete replacement of fish meal (FM) with BSFLM in the diet of Oreochromis niloticus. Fingerlings (average body weight:1.23 g) were divided into five groups and reared on 32% CP experimental diets with replacement of FM with BSFLM at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, respectively. Results indicated the significant effect of FM replacement with BSFLM on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, FCR, activity of digestive enzymes, biochemical indices, intestinal and liver morphology, and expression of growth hormone, myoblast determination protein 1, and Myostatin genes. The 50% followed by 75% replacement of FM demonstrated the most significant positive effect on these parameters, while 100% replacement showed the most notable negative impact. In addition, some parameters like proximate composition, the status of antioxidant enzymes, and expression of stress-related genes heat shock proteins (HSP-70 and HSP-90) did not show any statistical difference among groups except a D100 (100% FM replacement) group, which showed higher activity of CAT, SOD, and mRNA levels of HSPs. Based on current findings, replacing 50% of FM with BSFLM in the diet of O. niloticus is recommended to reduce production costs.",

This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of novel inflammatory biomarkers for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n\nThis retrospective cross-sectional study included 207 hospitalized patients diagnosed with clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Laboratory data collected upon admission included complete blood count parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, and albumin levels. Systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), CRP-to-albumin ratio (CAR), CRP-to-lymphocyte ratio (CLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index were calculated.\n\nThe cohort was predominantly male (69%, n = 142) with a mean age of 62.1 ± 16.3 years.

Moreover, protein kinase D 1 (PKD1), a serine/threonine protein kinase, has been shown to contribute to diet-induced adiposity. Therefore, we investigated if PKD isoforms mediate hypoxia-induced dysfunction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Hypoxia increased phosphorylation of PKD1 at serine 916 (S916), the autophosphorylation site linked to PKD1 activation, indicating hypoxia-induced activation of PKD1 in adipocytes. Inhibition or depletion of PKD isoforms mitigated hypoxia-induced increase in hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), the master transcription factor mediating hypoxia-induced gene expression, confirming that PKDs modulate the hypoxia-induced mechanism in adipocytes. Surprisingly, depletion of PKD1 and PKD2, but not PKD3, attenuated hypoxia-induced HIF1α target gene expression. Unlike PKD3, PKD1 and PKD2 possess a unique PDZ-binding motif at their C-terminus. Indeed, hypoxia upregulated a PDZ-containing scaffold protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) and its interaction with PKD1, whereas NHERF1 depletion attenuated hypoxia-induced PKD1 phosphorylation, HIF1α protein accumulation, and gene expression. Mechanistically, hypoxia induced nuclear import of active PKD1, which phosphorylated histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) at S498 that promoted cytoplasmic localization of HDAC5. HDAC5 deacetylated heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) at lysine 77, which dissociated HSP70 from HIF1α, allowing HSP90 association that stabilized HIF1α. Interestingly, PKD inhibition reversed hypoxia effects on subcellular localization of PKD1/HDAC5, HSP70 acetylation, and HIF1α/HSP90 association. In summary, our findings reveal a NHERF1-PKD1-HDAC5 mechanism modulating hypoxia-induced gene expression in adipocytes.",

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), CONSTANS (CO) activates the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT); this activation is a crucial aspect of the daylength-dependent regulation of flowering time. Here, we demonstrate that the basic leucine zipper 3 (bZIP3) transcription factor is important for CO-induced FT expression under long photoperiod conditions in Arabidopsis. We isolated bZIP3 as a CO-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening and verified bZIP3-CO complex formation in Arabidopsis through co-immunoprecipitation assays. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of bZIP3 are very similar to those of CO, and bZIP3 protein levels fluctuate throughout the day, with high abundance in the late afternoon. The bzip3 mutant displayed delayed flowering under long photoperiods, whereas bZIP3 overexpression accelerated flowering regardless of daylength. bZIP3 directly binds to the FT promoter region containing CO-responsive elements in vivo. FT messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the bzip3 mutant and bZIP3 overexpression lines correlated with their flowering times and changed only during the daytime. bZIP3 overexpression resulted in significantly lower FT transcript levels in the co mutant background than in the wild type. Furthermore, bZIP3 forms a complex with ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1), a CO partner that helps CO induce FT expression. The bzip3 as1 double mutant flowered later than the two single mutants under longer daylengths, and FT mRNA levels were much lower in the double mutant than in the bzip3 single mutant. Collectively, our findings uncover a new layer of photoperiod-dependent FT regulation in which bZIP3 facilitates CO to activate FT transcription by forming a complex with AS1.",

The patients were stratified into three categories: HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The primary outcome measure was all-cause in-hospital mortality. The prevalence and outcomes of various LVEF phenotypes were evaluated in adult patients with acute HF.\n\nThe mean age of the patients was 54.94 ± 15.83 years, of whom 207 (51%) were female (P = 0.004). Two hundred fifty-seven (63.3%) patients had HFrEF, 62 (15.3%) had HFmrEF, and 87 (21.4%) had HFpEF.

Investigating the diverse health benefits of natural food sources requires a holistic approach encompassing dietary intake evaluations, laboratory and animal studies, and human clinical research. These investigations examine the antimicrobial, antioxidant, cancer-fighting, and blood sugar-regulating properties of compounds derived from plants. Studies indicate that diets abundant in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables supply crucial nutrients and biologically active substances such as polyphenols and flavonoids, which provide protective benefits against long-term disease conditions, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.

    "combined_text": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor: A promising target for intestinal fibrosis therapy.\n\nIntestinal fibrosis, a severe complication of inflammatory bowel disease, leads to intestinal stenosis. Effective therapies for this condition are lacking. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a highly conserved nuclear transcription factor activated by diverse ligands, plays dual roles in fibrogenesis, but its relationship to intestinal fibrosis has not been comprehensively reviewed. This review explores the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis, and places particular focus on the mechanistic role of AhR signaling pathways, which may be mediated by dietary, microbial, and environmental ligands. We propose a new strategy for the targeting of AhR-related dietary ligands to prevent intestinal fibrosis. Dietary AhR ligands, such as glucobrassicin, flavonoids, and curcumin, exert anti-fibrotic effects by modulating the gut microbiota, suppressing collagen deposition, and inhibiting transforming growth factor-β pathways. Conversely, environmental pollutants (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, microplastics, and propiconazole) exacerbate fibrosis via AhR activation. In multiple disease models, 16S rRNA sequencing has revealed positive and negative linear relationships between the gut microbiota and fibrosis. Intestinal microbiota-derived metabolites also affect fibrosis, including via immune cell regulation to indirectly reduce collagen deposition and direct action on extracellular matrix-related proteins to relieve intestinal fibrosis. The interaction among the AhR, microbiota, and diet suggests new therapeutic strategies, such as dietary interventions and fecal microbiota transplantation, to restore the microbial balance and inhibit fibrosis. The promotion of intestinal fibrosis by AhR agonists in environmental pollutants further emphasizes the need to reduce exposure to environmental toxins while following a plant-based diet rich in AhR agonists.",

Despite PtHSP40-III shows relatively lower transcriptional level in hemocyte, its transcripts could be significantly induced by Vibrio alginolyticus. The recombinant protein of PtHSP40-III displays binding activity toward both Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN).

    "combined_text": "Stearidonic Acid-Enriched Buglossoides arvensis Oil Alleviates High-Fat Diet-Induced Hepatic Lipid Accumulation and Inflammation via AMPK/SIRT1 Activation in Rats.\n\nBuglossoides arvensis oil (BO) is rich in plant-based omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), including stearidonic acid (SDA). Dietary oils enriched with n-3 PUFAs have been shown to exert beneficial effects on inflammation and lipid metabolism; however, the effects of SDA-enriched BO (SBO) remain unclear.\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effects of SBO (n-3 PUFA: 67.1%, SDA: 38.5%) included in a high-fat (HF; 45% kcal from fat) diet on hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation.\n\nFour-wk-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 6/group) and fed different diets for 9 wk: HF, HF with 10% BO (HF+BO), and HF with 10% SBO (HF+SBO) diet groups. At the end of the experiment, we analyzed lipid profiles in the serum and liver; assessed the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction; measured inflammatory cytokines protein level; and evaluated the activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).\n\nHF+SBO group significantly reduced body weight and hepatic lipid accumulation compared with HF diet feeding (P < 0.05). Serum and hepatic lipid levels were significantly lower, whereas fecal lipid excretion was significantly higher in the HF+SBO group compared to the HF group (P < 0.05). The expression of lipid metabolism-related genes was significantly downregulated in the HF+SBO group, and AMPK and SIRT1 activity were increased 1.53- and 2.28-fold, respectively, compared with the HF group (P < 0.05). BO and SBO intake inhibited NF-κB activation by 27.5% and 41.8%, respectively, and reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with HF diet feeding (P < 0.05). Moreover, SBO was more effective than BO in this regard.\n\nThese findings suggest that SBO more effectively mitigates hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation in rats fed HF diet, a phenomenon partly related to the increased activation of AMPK and SIRT1. This indicates that SBO may provide greater benefits than BO in improving lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses.",

Angiotensinogen (AGT) is a component of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), that regulates blood pressure. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that two A/G polymorphisms (rs2493134 and rs2004776), located at +507 and +1164 in intron I of the human AGT (hAGT) gene, are linked to hypertension. AGT polymorphisms result in two haplotypes, Hap-I a pro-hypertensive, whereas Hap-II is normotensive. Previous studies support the role of epigenetics in blood pressure regulation. In this study we generated transgenic mice (TG) with hAGT containing Hap-I and Hap-II variants to investigate the effect of high salt diet (HSD) on epigenetics and transcriptional regulation.\n\nWe treated Hap-I and Hap-II TG mice with 4% HSD and identified DNA methylation patterns. We measured hAGT mRNA and protein by qPCR and immunoblot respectively. ChIP assay and RNA sequencing were performed.\n\nhAGT gene expression is increased by HSD in both Hap-I and Hap-II TG mice. In the liver and kidney, we observed significantly higher DNA demethylation (less CpG's) and stronger binding of transcription factors in the promoter of Hap-I TG mice as compared to Hap-II post HSD. RNA-Seq identified differentially expressed genes, novel target genes, canonical pathways, and upstream regulators associated with hypertension.\n\nOur findings identified a novel high salt-sensitive risk haplotype, novel CpG sites and DNA methylation patterns, potential gene targets, and pathways implicated in hypertension.

With increasing interest in natural products, Centella asiatica has garnered attention for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of C. asiatica extracts (CE) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T).\n\n: CEs were prepared by extracting C. asiatica leaf powder using ethanol at concentrations of 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%. In LPS-stimulated MAC-T cells, the study investigated the ability of CE to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and its impact on casein protein synthesis.\n\n: C. asiatica extract with 60% ethanol (CE60) exhibited the highest radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content among the tested extracts. In MAC-T cells, CE60 significantly attenuated LPS-induced inflammation by down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, as well as inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B activation. CE60 also reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species through upregulating nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 and associated antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 1, GPx4, superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1, SOD2, and catalase. Moreover, CE60 restored the synthesis of casein proteins (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, and CSN2) in LPS-treated MAC-T cells, indicating a protective effect on lactation function under inflammatory conditions.\n\n: Taken together, CE60 has potential as a natural substance for the prevention of bovine mastitis by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in mammary epithelial cells.",

Treatments were randomly assigned to pens within blocks, with four replicates per treatment. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design arranged as 2 x 2 factorial, with two levels of zilpaterol (0 and 0.20 mg/kg of live weight/d, as hydrochloride form) and two levels of virginiamycin (0 and 22 mg/lamb/d). The diet was based on cracked corn (1.41 Mcal NEg/kg of dry matter and 14.1% of crude protein). Growth performance and dietary energetics variables were recorded. After the feeding trial, lambs were transported to a slaughterhouse for assessment of carcass characteristics, visceral organ mass, and primal cuts.\n\n: No interactions were observed between zilpaterol and virginiamycin treatments for most of the evaluated variables, except for the percentage of the empty small intestine. Lambs supplemented with both zilpaterol and virginiamycin showed improvements in live weight, feed efficiency, and energy retention. However, only zilpaterol affected dressing percentage, longissimus thoracis muscle, and body fat reduction. The combined supplementation increased final live weight without altering feed intake, thereby enhancing energy availability to promote carcass weight and dressing carcass compared to lambs treated with zilpaterol alone.\n\n: Zilpaterol hydrochloride (0.20mg/kg of live weight/d, equivalent to 7.55 mg/lamb/d) and virginiamycin (22 mg/lamb/d) improved growth and energy retention, but only zilpaterol improved dressing percentage and reduced fat traits of carcass and non-carcass components. The effects of virginiamycin and zilpaterol were found to be cumulative, with better responses in growth and dietary energy components observed in lambs supplemented with both additives.",

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of supplementing urea-biuret (UB) and urea-biuret-nitrate (UBN) mixtures relative to urea (U) on rumen fermentation and microbial N outflow in growing steers. Twelve American Aberdeen steers were used in a replicated and balanced 3 × 3 Latin square design (LSD) with three periods of 35 days each. Steers were housed in pens and consumed a corn silage-based diet. Steers were stratified by body weight and randomly allocated to one of the three NPN supplementation treatments. Treatments were supplementation with U, UB, and UBN, adjusted to the amount of N provided by U when included at 1% of the diet on a dry matter (DM) basis. Intake and feeding behavior were individually recorded throughout the experiment. In each period, steers were adapted to increasing levels of NPN during the first 8 days. From day 19 to 23, feed and fecal samples were collected to assess nutrient digestibility. Samples of blood, rumen contents, and omasal digesta were collected on d 20 to 23. On d 24, rumen evacuation was performed and subsequently steers were dosed with Co-EDTA and YbCl3 to determine the passage rate of digesta flow. Rumen fluid collection was conducted on d 24 and 25. Steers did not receive NPN supplementation from day 26 to 35 during the washout period. Microbial N flow was estimated for each animal within periods. Intake, digestibility, digesta flow, and microbial N flow were analyzed using a 3 × 3 LSD, while blood and rumen fermentation parameters were analyzed using a 3 × 3 LSD with repeated measures. Steers supplemented with UB tended (P < 0.07) to consume more DM and organic matter (OM) than those supplemented with UBN; however, animals supplemented with UBN tended (P = 0.051) to digest more acid detergent fiber in the total tract. Steers supplemented with U and UB showed greater (P < 0.05) DM and OM flow throughout the omasum than those with UBN. Microbial N flow, microbial efficiency, and the concentration of total volatile fatty acids were not different (P > 0.10) among NPN-supplemented treatments. Steers supplemented with UBN showed lesser (P < 0.05) concentration of ammonia than those with U and UB. In conclusion, novel NPN mixtures have the potential to modify ruminal fermentation without affecting microbial protein outflow.",

The objective of this experiment was to examine the effect of varying dietary trypsin inhibitor units (TIU) on the performance, nitrogen digestibility and retention in nursery pigs. Sixty barrows (5.6 ± 0.65 kg body weight [BW]), weaned at 19-21 d of age, were randomly allocated across six dietary treatments (n=10/treatment). Diets balanced for metabolizable energy (ME), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine were fed in two phases over the 42-d study, lasting 14 and 28 d, respectively. Dietary treatments were formulated on a soybean TIU protein (TIU/mg) basis, using soybean meal, raw whole soybeans, soybean oil, and soyhulls to target 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 TIU/mg in complete feed for both dietary phases. For phase 1 and 2 diets, analyzed TIU/mg were 0.22/0.54, 0.47/0.61, 1.71/1.98, 2.88/3.44, 3.79/4.01, and 6.15/5.42, respectively, averaging 0.38, 0.54, 1.85, 3.16, 3.9, and 5.79 TIU/mg across both phases. Pigs were individually housed with ad libitum access to water and feed. Pig BW and feed disappearance were measured at the start and end of each phase to calculate pig performance parameters. On d 17, a subgroup of 48 pigs (n=8/treatment) were moved to metabolism crates for total fecal and urine collection to analyze nitrogen digestibility and retention. Data were analyzed using pig as the experimental unit to assess the effect of analyzed TIU levels, including linear and quadratic contrasts on all parameters. No quadratic responses were reported overall (P > 0.05). At the end of the experiment, pig BW decreased from 25.3 to 15.5 kg as the diet increased from 0.38 to 5.79 TIU/mg (linear, P < 0.0001). Moreover, as TIU increased, overall average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and feed efficiency were attenuated, resulting in reductions by 49, 32, and 26%, respectively (linear, P < 0.01). During phase 2, at the highest levels of dietary TIU/mg, nitrogen digestibility (%) was reduced by 5.3% (linear, P = 0.001), and nitrogen retention (% of intake) decreased by 15.3% (linear, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, there was a constant reduction in growth performance, feed efficiency, and nitrogen retention as soybean TIU increased in the diet of nursery pigs.",

A Melissopalynological procedure was used to identify floral origin while proximate and mineral contents were analyzed by standard methods. Five major bee floras namely Bidens spp., Guizotia scabra, Croton macrostachyus, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Zea mays were identified and analyzed. The proximate composition results showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) among the tested bee pollen. The results indicated the mean content of Moisture (13.29%), Ash (2.03%), Fat (4.27%), Protein (17.76%), Fiber (2.68%), and Carbohydrate (59.94%). All bee pollen types exhibited statistically significant (p < 0.05) on minerals except on Mn (p > 0.05). The mean content of K (5368.4), P (2537.5), Fe (91.4), Mn (30.9) and Na (144.7) mg/kg in dry weight was observed. Z. mays had the highest moisture and protein content, E. camaldulensis had the highest ash and K content, while the highest P, Fe and Na was recorded by C. macrostachyus pollen sample. From the minerals, the highest and lowest amount was K (5368.4 mg/kg) and Mn (30.9 mg/kg) respectively.

These endogenously expressed molecules exhibit significant evolutionary conservation, a feature vital for identifying new conserved miRNAs across various plant and animal species. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa Linn.), a member of the Asteraceae family, stands out as a leafy vegetable with exceptional nutritional value. Given its significance, this study aimed to discover and describe new conserved miRNAs in lettuce. The investigation employed computational techniques to explore the lettuce genome leading to the identification of 27 conserved miRNAs from 27 families. Notably, three clusters of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), including lsa-MIR165, lsa-MIR168, and lsa-MIR3630, were also identified. To validate the computational predictions, seven randomly selected miRNAs were experimentally validated using RT-PCR. Additionally, the study delved into the protein targets of the identified miRNAs, resulting in the identification of 74 protein targets associated with 97 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and significant biological processes. The computational analysis of targets also shed light on their potential roles in post-transcriptional regulation. The presence of three precursor miRNA clusters suggested coordinated regulatory functions. The identification of conserved miRNAs and their associated protein targets opens avenues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory processes in this economically significant leafy vegetable and the knowledge gained from this research lays the groundwork for potential applications in modulating miRNAs to control desired features in lettuce, thereby contributing to the improvement of this essential crop.",

Understanding genetic diversity and conserving wheat germplasm is essential for developing cultivars resilient to climate change. This study investigates grain quality, nutritional profiles, and genetic diversity across a selection of Egyptian and internationally sourced wheat cultivars. Physical and chemical analyses were conducted to assess grain/flour quality, hardness, and micronutrient content. Genetic diversity was evaluated using protein profiling, SCoT markers, and rbcL chloroplast DNA barcoding, chosen for its highly conserved nature and proven utility in plant species identification and phylogenetic analysis, making it a reliable marker for assessing genetic relationships among wheat cultivars. The findings from this study revealed distinct patterns of genetic variation and highlight valuable traits within the germplasm, providing crucial information for developing wheat cultivars adapted to diverse climatic conditions.\n\nPhysical and biochemical analyses revealed that two Egyptian cultivars, Sohag 5 and Misr 1, exhibited superior quality and nutritional value among the nine evaluated wheat cultivars. Both showed favorable physical properties (e.g., grain weight, falling number, gluten content). Sohag 5 was notably rich in carbohydrates, protein content, and essential minerals (zinc, calcium, magnesium), while Misr 1 also maintained healthy carbohydrate and gluten levels. Genetic diversity analysis, employing SDS-PAGE protein profiling and SCoT markers, effectively differentiated the wheat cultivars. These molecular markers consistently grouped the cultivars, generally distinguished between bread wheat and durum wheat varieties, and provided insights into the genetic relationships between Egyptian and imported lines. While the specific clustering patterns varied between marker types, particularly with rbcL sequences providing a distinct grouping since the rbcL chloroplast gene exhibited limited resolution for differentiating closely related cultivars. The combined genetic data confirmed significant diversity within the germplasm. Overall, the analysis identified two primary genetic groups among the cultivars, with Group I comprising seven diverse cultivars and Group II containing two distinct cultivars (Benisuif 6 and Sohag 5).\n\nOverall, the investigated Egyptian wheat cultivars demonstrated competitive or superior performance in standard physical and nutritional parameters compared to the imported varieties, with Sohag 5 and Misr 1 notably excelling in grain quality and micronutrient content. The genetic diversity analysis, incorporating protein profiling, SCoT markers, and rbcL chloroplast DNA barcoding, effectively characterized the genetic landscape of the cultivars. A key finding was the consistent genetic distinction of specific Egyptian cultivars, notably Sohag 5 and Benisuif 6, which clustered uniquely, aligning with their classification as durum wheat varieties. This revealed genetic relationships, alongside the identified superior traits (e.g., in Sohag 5), provides valuable insights that can be strategically utilized in breeding programs to develop new wheat cultivars with enhanced quality and adaptability to diverse climatic conditions.",

Emerging evidence has identified bacterial lipopolysaccharides in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, highlighting the intricate relationship between the gastrointestinal tract, gut microbiome, and the central and enteric nervous systems-commonly referred to as the \"microbiota-gut-brain axis.\" In this review, we explore the mechanisms by which the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to AD pathogenesis. We propose that sufficient levels of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the bioactive form of vitamin A, enhance intestinal barrier integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins and modulating immune function through the induction of regulatory T-cell differentiation, thereby mitigating inflammation. Furthermore, dietary fiber complements this process by promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, via bacterial fermentation. Butyrate, in turn, acts as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, upregulating ATRA bioavailability by elevating aldehyde dehydrogenase gene expression. Our mechanistic framework is supported by the endotoxin hypothesis of AD, which purports that the movement of infectious pathogens across the blood-brain barrier causes a vicious cycle of neuroinflammation, a key factor of AD pathogenesis, leading to amyloid-beta deposition, microglial activation, and CYP26A1-mediated ATRA degradation. Finally, we discuss microbiome-based therapeutic strategies and dietary interventions, including prebiotic compounds, probiotic bacteria, fecal microbiota transplantation, the MIND diet, and a combined approach consisting of vitamins A/D, and dietary fiber, as potential approaches to mitigate AD progression via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

    "combined_text": "The Effect of the Inflammatory Microenvironment on Odontogenic Differentiation of Dental Pulp Stem Cells.\n\nThe dental pulp not only serves as the tooth's nutritional core but also creates a finely tuned microenvironment that is enriched with blood vessels, nerves, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules, all of which guide the fate of resident dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Trauma and microbial invasion disrupt this niche, leading to pulpitis and necrosis. Although conventional root canal treatment preserves the tooth's structure by removing infected pulp, it can increase tooth brittleness and impede root development in immature permanent teeth. Harnessing DPSCs' multipotency for pulp regeneration promises to restore the natural pulp-dentin complex in situ. Importantly, DPSCs encounter an inflammatory microenvironment composed of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, a spectrum of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, diverse immune cell phenotypes, and altered matrix signals. While earlier work examined the isolated effects of mediators such as lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or macrophage-derived exosomes on odontogenic differentiation, this review focuses on how these mediators collectively interact in both synergistic and antagonistic ways within the inflammatory niche. We systematically delineate how these collective stimuli converge on wingless/integrated/beta-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and bone morphogenetic protein/Sma and Mad related protein pathways to modulate key odontogenic markers (runt-related transcription factor 2, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, alkaline phosphatase) and mineralization outcomes. By applying a microenvironment-centric lens, we reveal novel targets and strategies to recalibrate inflammation, steer DPSCs toward reparative odontogenesis, and ultimately enhance the efficacy of regenerative endodontic therapies.",

Ferroptosis is a new form of cell death, and induction of ferroptosis has an inhibitory effect on tumors. Silencing of the ferroptosis inhibitory molecule FA complementation group D2 protein (FANCD2) has been reported to inhibit tumor growth. This investigation aims to explore whether MR treatment affects ferroptosis of gastric cancer cells by regulating FANCD2 expression, and thus affects the advancement of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer cells (AGS and HGC27) were cultured in MR condition. For ferroptosis detection, lipid ROS was examined by fluorescent staining; ACSL4 levels were estimated by western blot; malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) levels were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Transfection of FANCD2/METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) overexpression plasmids was to conduct in gain of function tests. SRAMP analysis was to predict the m6A methylation site of FANCD2, with methylated RNA immunoprecipitation detection of m6A levels of FANCD2 mRNA, and Actinomycin D experiments to evaluate its stability. Gastric cancer cells were administered through tail vein injection into BALB/c mice to conduct transplanted tumor models, and mice were given an MR diet or combined with an injection of oeFANCD2/oeMETTL3 lentivirus. The effect of FANCD2/METTL3 overexpression on tumor volume and ferroptosis was measured. The gastric cancer patient-derived organoids were also cultured and treated with MR, and the diameter was analyzed. MR treatment increased ferroptosis and reduced the volume of tumor tissue. FANCD2 levels were found to change dramatically following MR treatment, and overexpressing FANCD2 inhibited ferroptosis and promoted tumor formation. In addition, MR treatment decreased FANCD2 m6A abundance as well as FANCD2 mRNA stability. Database predictions suggested that METTL3 may be an m6A regulatory molecule influenced by MR, and our results showed that METTL3 was down-regulated under MR conditions, and METTL3 overexpression increased the m6A abundance and stability of FANCD2 mRNA. Further results showed that overexpressing METTL3 reduced ferroptosis-related indexes and increased the tumor volume, inhibiting METTL3 reversed the results. Furthermore, MR reduced the diameter of gastric cancer organoids. MR inhibits FANCD2 m6A levels and FANCD2 stability by inhibiting METTL3 expression, and then promotes ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells.",

Currently, the market offers a wide range of plant-based milk analogs (PBMAs), most of which are manufactured using top-down methods that involve the mechanical disruption of plant tissues to create an aqueous dispersion of small particles, such as those found in soy, oat, coconut, or almond milks. However, PBMAs can also be constructed using bottom-up approaches, which involve homogenizing water, a plant-based oil, and a plant-based emulsifier together to produce a milk-like colloidal dispersion containing emulsifier-coated oil droplets dispersed in water. The plant-based oils used for this purpose include corn, flaxseed, olive, safflower, sunflower, and vegetable oils, while the plant-based emulsifiers include amphiphilic proteins, polysaccharides, and phospholipids. This article provides a comprehensive review of PBMAs prepared using the bottom-up method, including fabrication methods, ingredient functionality, and product design. In particular, the design of PBMAs with structural, physicochemical, functional, nutritional, and sensory properties similar to those of cow's milk is emphasized. In addition, the article highlights the feasibility of using PBMAs produced using the bottom-up method to create other kinds of plant-based dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt, cream, ice cream, and butter. This is typically done by creating plant-based analogs of milk fat globules and casein micelles. One of the key advantages of the bottom-up approach is that the physicochemical, functional, and nutritional properties of PBMAs can be carefully controlled, which can increase their performance and versatility. However, several technical challenges still remain, such as the need to better match the gelling, foaming, and nutritional properties of cow's milk, which will require further research.",

This review systematically outlines essential components of CKD care from A to Z, offering evidence-based guidance to enhance patient management. Anemia treatment emphasizes iron supplementation, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and novel hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. Achieving optimal blood pressure control through renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and calcium channel blockers reduces cardiovascular risk and delays CKD progression. Cardiovascular risk management includes statins combined with ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, along with appropriate anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation. Individualized glycemic control strategies prioritize sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for their cardiovascular and renal protective effects. Vigilance in avoiding nephrotoxic agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, aminoglycosides, and contrast media, is essential for preventing renal injury. Rigorous management of electrolytes and acid-base disturbances, involving dietary sodium and potassium restrictions, phosphate binders, and bicarbonate supplementation, reduces CKD progression and related complications. Appropriate fluid management through dietary sodium and water restriction with individualized diuretic therapy prevents volume overload and associated cardiovascular complications. Nutritional interventions, particularly low-protein diets supplemented with ketoanalogues of amino acids, effectively delay CKD progression and control metabolic disturbances. Therapies addressing CKD-related mineral and bone disorders, including phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, and calcimimetics, reduce the risk of vascular calcification. In addition, lipid-lowering therapies, anticoagulation therapy, optimal vascular access management for dialysis, and early detection of arrhythmias and thrombotic microangiopathy significantly enhance patient outcomes. Attention to quality-of-life issues, such as alleviating xerosis symptoms, promoting optimal body mass index through weight management strategies, and providing psychosocial support, further enhances patient-centered care.

Baicalein has demonstrated potential benefits in the prevention and treatment of liver diseases. However, the mechanisms by which baicalein ameliorates hepatic ferroptosis in MASH remain inadequately understood. In this study, we established a mouse model of MASH induced by Western diet (WD) feeding. Our findings indicate that baicalein treatment ameliorated metabolic abnormalities and inhibited the progression of MASH in mice. Most importantly, baicalein supplementation significantly restored iron homeostasis in the liver, mitigating disorders such as iron overload and ferritin transport Additionally, baicalein reduced WD-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation. The protective effects of exogenous baicalein on ferroptosis were also observed in free fatty acid (FFA)-treated Raw264.7 cells. Mechanistically, macrophage, rather than hepatocyte, were implicated in the effect of baicalein. Furthermore, baicalein treatment inhibited WD or FFA-induced M1 polarization while activating the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/ ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (Nrf2/FSP1) signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that exogenous baicalein inhibits hepatic ferroptosis in MASH by promoting M2 polarization of macrophage through the Nrf2/FSP1 pathway, establishing that baicalein as a promising candidate drug for the treatment of hepatic ferroptosis in MASH.",

Twenty-four Sarda dairy sheep, homogeneous in body weight (BW; 59.1 ± 0.75 kg), milk yield (MY; 2.4 ± 0.007 kg/day), and days in milk (DIM; 101 ± 1 days), were allocated into three treatment groups. The control group (CTR) received no GP supplementation, the GP100 group was supplemented with 100 g/day per head of GP, and the GP150 group with 150 g/day per head of GP. The trial lasted six weeks, including one week for adaptation and five for sampling. Feed intake was recorded daily using an individual automatic feeding system (Biocontrol AS, Rakkestad, Norway), and individual milk samples were collected weekly. Methane emissions were measured during the final week of the trial over three consecutive days during both morning and evening milkings, with two-minute measurements per ewe. The inclusion of GP, at both dosages, did not affect milk yield, fat content, or protein content. However, GP reduced the concentration of saturated fatty acids (SFA) while increasing monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and total unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the milk. Notably, GP150 significantly increased the levels of CLA cis-9, trans-11 and C18:1 trans-11 compared to the CTR and GP100 groups. ME, expressed as respiration and eructation peaks, were not affected by GP supplementation. The means of concentration of methane during eructation events were 188.7, 160.64 and 185.45 ppm for CTR, GP100 and GP150, respectively. These results suggest that including 100 to 150 g of GP per day in the diet of lactating ewes can improve the fatty acid profile of milk without negatively impacting production traits, offering potential benefits for milk quality.",

    "combined_text": "Positive selection at core genes may underlie niche adaptation in Fusobacterium animalis.\n\nFusobacterium animalis (Fa) was identified as the most enriched Fusobacterium species in colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, a group of Fa core genes were found to be highly expressed intratumorally and to favor intracellular survival. We hypothesized that, because they promote bacterial fitness in the intracellular niche, these genes might be targets of positive selection, a process that often underlies adaptation to variable environments.\n\nWe performed an evolutionary analysis to identify selective events that occurred over different time frames, namely during the divergence of the Fusobacterium species and in the more recent separation of the Fa lineage from F. paranimalis. Results indicated that the coding sequences of these genes have been targeted by intense purifying selection, possibly as the result of their often-essential functions. However, localized signatures of positive selection were also detectable. During the divergence of Fusobacterium species, the major target of positive selection was represented by elongation factor-Tu, a finding that may be related to its moonlighting functions in adhesion and biofilm development. Additional targets were RpoC and the septum-determining protein MinD. We suggest that variations in the latter contribute to the observed differences in cell length and width between F. watanabei and Fa. We also searched for and detected beneficial changes that occurred specifically in the Fa lineage, suggesting that such variants promote intracellular growth or adaptation to the tumor microenvironment. The strongest target of selection was DnaK, which was shown to promote malignant transformation in other bacterial systems. Analysis of the selected sites in DnaK indicated that most of them are located in the C-terminal unstructured region and that they determine the appearance of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs). Specifically, one ELM is a casein kinase 2 phosphorylation site, whereas two additional ELMs are involved in SUMOylation and USP7-mediated deubiquitination. USP is a central modulator of the p53-MDM2 pathway and we propose that SUMOylation facilitates the nuclear import of Fa DnaK where USP7 promotes its stability.\n\nWe identified specific proteins and amino acid changes that are expected to underlie phenotypic diversity in Fusobacteria. These data are relevant to inform future analyses of Fa oncogenic potential.",

Nevertheless, existing metabarcoding and metagenomic studies consistently resolve a putative beneficial Mycoplasma species as the most abundant organism in gut samples. The remaining microbiome is heavily influenced by factors such as developmental stage and water salinity. We profiled the salmon gut microbiome across 540 salmon samples in differing conditions with a view to capture the genomic diversity that can be resolved from the salmon gut. The salmon were exposed to 3 different nutritional additives: seaweed, blue mussel protein and silaged blue mussel protein, including both pre-smolts (30-60 g salmon reared in freshwater) as well as post-smolts (300-600 g salmon reared in saltwater). Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we generated a catalogue of 11 species-level bacterial MAGs from 188 input metagenome assembled genomes, with 5 species not found in other catalogues. This highlights that our understanding of salmon gut microbial diversity is still incomplete. A prevalent bacterial genome annotated as Mycoplasmoidaceae is present in adult fish, and a comparison of functions revealed significant sub-species variation. Juvenile fish have a different microbial diversity, dominated by a species of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also present the first viral catalogue for salmon including prophage sequences which can be linked to the bacterial MAGs.",

Intermittent exposure to PTH results in bone formation being greater than bone resorption, and this effect has been harnessed through the development of agonists of the PTH and PTH-related protein type 1 receptor (PTH1R) to treat osteoporosis. Teriparatide, an analogue of the first 34 amino acids of PTH, and abaloparatide, which resembles PTH-related protein (PTHrP) in structure, are PTH1R agonists currently in clinical use. Both medications have been shown to increase bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip. Randomized controlled trials with teriparatide or abaloparatide have also provided evidence of reduction in vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. The ACTIVE trial suggested slightly greater efficacy for major osteoporotic fractures (as an exploratory end point) for abaloparatide than for teriparatide. A similar potential superiority was suggested for hip fracture in a real-world, observational study. Side effects of these medications are usually transient, and although a risk of osteosarcoma was suggested by studies using murine models, no such risk has been observed in extensive human studies. Overall, both teriparatide and abaloparatide have demonstrated convincing clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, with a reassuring safety profile. Potential differences in their effects on bone mineral density and their antifracture effects offer avenues for differentiation but require further validation in appropriately designed studies.",

Due to its complex pathogenesis, no approved pharmacological treatments currently exist. The research sought to explore the combined impact of metformin (Met) and berberine (BBR) on NAFLD, focusing on the AMPK-SREBP1-FASN pathway implicated in liver lipid regulation. The study design incorporated in both living organisms and laboratory conditions to examine how these interventions influenced NAFLD-associated metabolic abnormalities. The HFD-fed mice provided insight into systemic effects, while the OA/PA-stimulated HepG2 cells offered a controlled environment to investigate cellular mechanisms. By employing this dual approach, the researchers could thoroughly characterize the efficacy of Met, BBR, and their combination in mitigating metabolic disturbances. An Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase(AMPK) inhibitor was used in cellular experiments to verify the AMPK-dependent mechanism. Our findings highlight that compared to monotherapies, combination treatment significantly enhanced AMPK activation and inhibited sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) expression and that of its downstream target fatty acid synthase (FASN). In HepG2 cells, these effects were partially reversed by the AMPK inhibitor, confirming AMPK dependence. In vivo, the combined therapy effectively inhibited body weight gain, reduced visceral fat accumulation, improved insulin sensitivity, and attenuated hepatic steatosis and inflammation. The combination of metformin and berberine exerts synergistic effects in ameliorating NAFLD by activating AMPK, downregulating SREBP1 and FASN, and improving lipid metabolism. These findings provide evidence supporting a potentially effective multi-modal treatment approach for NAFLD.",

CELF1 enhances isoproterenol-induced beige adipocyte activation and mitochondrial respiration in vitro, and Celf1 overexpression ameliorates diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction.

Dysregulation of these processes may result in iron deficiency or overload, both associated with significant health implications.

Palmitic acid (PA), the most prevalent type of SFA, is selected as the representative model for this study. Palmitoyltransferases play crucial roles in protein palmitoylation mediated by PA; however, the most significantly altered palmitoyltransferase under high-SFA dietary conditions remains unidentified. This study reveals zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 12 (ZDHHC12) as a key protein in PA-driven HCC progression that functions by stabilizing the oncogenic histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). Mechanistically, PA supplementation upregulates ZDHHC12 expression by activating the transcription factor SWI/SNF-related BAF chromatin remodeling complex subunit ATPase 4 (SMARCA4). ZDHHC12 mediates HDAC8 palmitoylation at cysteine 244, thereby inhibiting its lysosomal degradation and ultimately promoting HCC progression. This study reveals that ZDHHC12 is a critical mediator of PA-induced HCC progression and that targeting HDAC8 can suppress this process. These findings offer a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC patients with high dietary intake of SFAs, particularly PA.",

Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory glycoprotein naturally found in bovine colostrum and milk that is low in MR.

Minimally invasive techniques, such as oblique lumbar debridement with posterior percutaneous fixation, may reduce surgical damage and improve recovery. However, their efficacy remains unclear. This study compares this minimally invasive approach with conventional surgery to assess its feasibility as an alternative treatment.\n\nA retrospective analysis was conducted on 156 patients diagnosed with single-segment lumbar tuberculosis between July 2016 and October 2019. Patients were divided into a minimally invasive group (Min group, n = 76), treated with the oblique lumbar approach combined with Posterior Percutaneous Pedicle Screw Fixation (PPPSF), and a conventional Open group (n = 80). All patients received standard anti-tuberculosis therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for at least two weeks preoperatively and continued for 10-12 months postoperatively, adjusted based on drug sensitivity testing. Nutritional support and bracing for three months post-surgery were also provided. Surgical and postoperative metrics were evaluated, including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of abdominal incision, postoperative drainage volume and postoperative hospital stay. Functional outcomes were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and oswestry disability index (ODI), while serology markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were measured. Radiographic parameters, including the Cobb angle and sagittal vertical axis (SVA), were also evaluated. Postoperative complications were also documented.\n\nThe Min group demonstrated significantly shorter operation time, smaller incisions, reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and lower postoperative drainage and CPK levels compared to the conventional Open group (\n\nOblique lumbar debridement with PPPSF represents a viable alternative to traditional anterior-posterior surgery for single-segment lumbar tuberculosis, offering reduced surgical trauma and accelerated postoperative recovery.",

AGEs affect sphingolipid metabolism increasing sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is in turn induces pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization through activation of RhoA/ROCK. The current study seeks to determine whether inhibition of AGEs by the anti-glycating vitamin B6 analog pyridoxamine prevents metaflammation via modulation of S1P/RhoA/ROCK signalling. Gastrocnemius muscle was obtained from mice fed a standard diet (SD) or a western diet (WD), supplemented or not with pyridoxamine (WD+PYR, 150mg/kg bw/day). Metabolic and inflammatory profiles have been investigated in plasma, while accumulation of AGE-modified proteins, expression of RAGE, S1P-synthesizing enzymes and S1P receptors, as well as activation of RhoA/ROCK/IRS-1 pathway have been analysed in gastrocnemius muscle. Markers of local inflammatory cells infiltration and macrophage polarization were also explored. In comparison to SD mice, WD mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and muscle lipid accumulation with increased plasma proinflammatory cytokines and muscle M1-polarized macrophage infiltration. WD mice muscle showed higher content of AGE-modified proteins with increased S1P synthesis and S1PR1 expression, paralleled by activation of RhoA/ROCK and impairment of insulin signalling. By inhibiting AGEs production through pyridoxamine supplementation, all the WD-induced metabolic and inflammatory signalling alterations were significantly reversed towards the SD state. The present findings confirm a relevant role for AGE/S1P/RhoA/ROCK signalling in diet-induced metaflammation, suggesting the formulation of pharmacological and nutraceutical tools to prevent AGEs accumulation as a useful strategy against obesity-related metabolic and inflammatory diseases.",

This was driven by the expression of the R2R3 MYB transcription factor (TF) gene PpMYB10.1. Transcriptome and degradome sequencing were used to identify the regulatory network upstream of PpMYB10.1. We identified and functionally verified that NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) TFs PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 are activators of anthocyanin accumulation. Protein-protein/DNA interaction assays were conducted, and it was observed that both PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 could form homodimers to directly activate the PpMYB10.1 promoter. Degradome analysis showed cleavage of PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 transcripts occurred via miR164a. Compared with peel and OF, a lower expression of miR164a in IF resulted in higher expression of PpNAC22 and PpNAC100. Functional characterisation showed that overexpression of miR164a significantly reduced anthocyanin accumulation driven by PpNAC22 and PpNAC100. Furthermore, another NAC TF, PpNAC29, was identified to be indirectly involved in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation. PpNAC29 formed a heterodimer with PpNAC22, although it could not bind to the PpMYB10.1 promoter. PpNAC29 transcription could be activated by PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 and the transcript was not targeted by miR164a, revealing a miR164a-PpNAC22/100-PpNAC29 cascade.

Target identification and validation were performed using network pharmacology, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance, and Western blotting.\n\nParthenolide inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle arrest in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. In vivo, parthenolide significantly suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor weight in BRAFi-resistant melanoma xenografts without apparent toxicity. Mechanistically, parthenolide stably interacted with the N-terminal ATPase domain of Hsp90α and dose-dependently inhibited its ATPase activity. Hsp90α functions as a chaperone for several oncoproteins involved in signaling pathways driving BRAFi resistance. Parthenolide reduced the levels of several Hsp90α client proteins and inhibited their downstream pathways, including PI3K/Akt, Ras/Raf/MEK, and Src/STAT3, in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. Moreover, the Hsp90 activator tamoxifen attenuated the effects of parthenolide in these cells.\n\nOur findings provide the first evidence that parthenolide can overcome BRAFi resistance in melanoma, highlighting its potential as a lead compound for the development of Hsp90α inhibitors to manage BRAFi-resistant cutaneous melanoma.",

In this review, molecular pathways connecting SERT dysfunction associated with depression are defined, including genetic polymorphisms (e.g., 5-HTTLPR), epigenetics (e.g., SLC6A4 methylation), and environmental interactions through stress and inflammation. Using a serotonergic pharmacophore, oxidative/nitrosative stress, cytokines, and neuroendocrine factors act via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis on SERT, whereas the crosstalk between SERT and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling both bring about changes in mood and influence the response to treatment. Pharmacological treatments, such as SSRIs and SNRIs, aim at SERT; however, their effectiveness is limited due to interindividual variability. New treatments consist of allosteric modulators, multimodal antidepressants, and non-pharmacological treatments, involving exercise, diet, and microbiome manipulation. Tailor-made treatments involving the utilization of pharmacogenomics and neurobiological profiling can improve clinical outcomes. This review highlights SERT as a complex target in MDD and provides an argument in support of integrative, precision-focused interventions that aim to target the affective and cognitive symptoms of MDD.",

To investigate the role of mitochondrial chaperone tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) in this process, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic deletion to knock out (KO) TRAP1 in colon cancer cells. Depletion of TRAP1 triggered a series of events: induced metabolic reprogramming, increased glycolytic flux, downregulation of mitochondrial complex I, and elevated ROS generation. TRAP1-deficient cells showed tolerance to Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitors and exhibited a higher extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Additionally, TRAP1 depletion activated hypoxia response elements (HREs) and upregulated HIF1A target genes such as GLUT1 and MCT1. Furthermore, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 1 (PDK1) was upregulated in KO cells, leading to the inactivation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). This metabolic shift towards glycolytic metabolism resulted in increased glycolytic metabolism, elevated lactic acid production, and higher glucose consumption, making TRAP1-depleted cancer cells more dependent on this altered metabolism for survival. Treatment with DCA, a PDK inhibitor, restored PDH activity, exacerbated oxidative stress, and increased cell death in KO cells. Our study here sheds light on how TRAP1 depletion affects metabolic plasticity, driving colon cancer cells to adapt to metabolic and oxidative stress. These findings highlight TRAP1 as a promising therapeutic target for manipulating metabolic plasticity and overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy.",

This study aimed to characterize the effect of butyrate on the expression of endothelial adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and its underlying mechanism in primary bovine umbilical vein endothelial cells (BUVEC). We hypothesized that butyrate increases endothelial ICAM-1 expression, and this effect is associated with the activation of the free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) or hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2) and/or inhibition of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). BUVEC were treated with different concentrations of butyrate, and a high increase in ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) adhesion was observed at 10 mM butyrate. We found that only HCA2 was expressed in BUVEC, and its activation did not induce ICAM-1 expression. Analysis of intracellular pathways revealed that butyrate increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and its inhibition reduced butyrate-induced ICAM-1 expression. We also demonstrated that BUVEC mainly express monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and that its inhibition reduces butyrate-induced ICAM-1 expression. Finally, we demonstrated that butyrate acts as an HDAC inhibitor and MCT1 is essential for this response. Overall, these findings provide a possible mechanism for the effects of butyrate on bovine endothelial cells, which could explain the exacerbated inflammatory response during nutritional imbalance in cattle.",

Here, we demonstrate that acute exposure to DON disrupts jejunal epithelial architecture and impairs barrier integrity in piglets by suppressing ISC proliferation and inhibiting differentiation of epithelial lineages along the crypt-villus axis. Consistently, DON reduces the ex vivo expansion capacity of jejunal crypt-derived intestinal organoids.

Excreted N can be lost to the environment as ammonia gas leading to environmental acidification and nutrient enrichment of sensitive habitats, and to watercourses contributing to aquatic eutrophication. While there is much evidence that NUE can be improved by reducing the crude protein (CP) content of dairy cow diets, the long-term impacts of feeding lower protein diets on cow performance and the rumen microbiome are less well understood. This study examined the effects of reducing the CP contents of dairy cow diets on cow performance, NUE, the relationship between NUE and residual feed intake (RFI), and the rumen microbiome.\n\nDietary CP content did not affect feed intake, milk yield or milk composition (P > 0.05), except for milk urea N (MUN), which increased with increasing diet CP content (P < 0.05). The mean NUE was 34%, 34% and 31% for the LCP (low-protein, 15%), MCP (medium-protein, 16%), and HCP (high-protein, 17%) diets, respectively. RFI was negatively correlated with NUE (r = -0.57, P < 0.001).

Coptisine is a bioactive component of Rhizoma coptidis with anti-diabetes property. The aim of this present study was to clarify the role and possible mechanism of coptisine underlying VEC dysfunction during gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with coptisine and/or high glucose (HG) medium. A GDM rat model was established by high-fat diet feeding and streptozotocin injection. Cell viability, migration, and angiogenesis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, wound healing assay, Transwell assay, and tube formation assay. The levels of angiogenesis-related proteins and the key markers in the Adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK)/nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway were tested by western blot analysis. The pathological changes of placental tissues were observed by HE staining. We found that the cell viability of HUVECs was repressed in HG conditions in a dose-dependent manner, and 25 mM HG reduced the HUVEC viability in a time-dependent manner. Coptisine (5 to 5o μM) did not cause cytotoxicity to HUVECs. In addition, HG-induced the decrease in cell viability and migration of HUVECs were rescued by coptisine in a dose-dependent manner. Coptisine restored the angiogenetic ability of HG-induced HUVECs by upregulating the protein expression of fibroblast growth factor 2, vascular endothelial-derived growth factor, and Angiotensin 1. Moreover, coptisine treatment re-activated the AMPK/NRF2 pathway in HG-stimulated HUVECs. Importantly, inhibition of AMPK/NRF2 signaling reverses the effect of coptisine on cell viability, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs. The in vivo study demonstrated that coptisine suppresses hyperglycemia and placenta injury in GDM rats. Coptisine protected HUVECs from hyperglycemic insult, suggesting the potential of coptisine which might be used as a therapeutic agent for VEC dysfunction in GDM.",

To fill this gap, this study analyzed comprehensive datasets from 2004 to 2024, covering 4840 patent applications, 170 drug pipelines, 123 clinical trials, and 44 licensing transactions, characterizing global trends, geographic distributions, collaborations, therapeutic landscapes, key targets, and stakeholder dynamics.

However, their structural complexities and functional constraints during processing may limit their usefulness. In recent years, ultrasound technology has received significant interest as an effective method for modifying fish protein's structure through the cavitation effect to improve their functionality. This review highlights current advances in ultrasound-assisted fish protein extraction, with an emphasis on structural modification and functional characteristics augmentation. The paper thoroughly assesses existing scientific knowledge and discusses potential research directions. Overall, ultrasound technology has the potential to be a successful assistant technique for improving fish protein extraction efficiency, along with benefits such as faster processing and lower resource use. Ultrasound can significantly improve the functionality and technological applicability of fish proteins by reducing aggregation, modifying secondary and tertiary structures in aqueous systems, and enhancing molecular flexibility and interfacial activity. However, it should be highlighted that achieving these great synergistic effects necessitates optimizing processing settings based on the specific ultrasound equipment employed, the fish species under study, and the type of protein. Future studies should focus on using ultrasound to carefully tune the structure of fish proteins for engineering and tailoring their functionality to boost their compatibility for complicated food processing techniques such as high moisture extrusion, 3D printing and for the development of hybrid foods in combination with emerging protein sources.",

Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method, with MR-Egger and weighted median serving as supplements in the preliminary MR.

The primary challenge is identifying patient subgroups with PTC and choosing the most effective treatment approach. To explore the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between high and low recurrent-risk PTCs, we collected 15 tissues comprising high (n = 7) and low (n = 8) recurrent-risk groups from PTC. The samples were detected by tandem mass tag labeling proteomics. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas data on thyroid cancer, prognosis-related DEPs were identified. Furthermore, an immunohistochemistry stain of 53 cases of PTC tumors was adopted to validate the relation of potential biomarkers with prognosis. We identified 8958 proteins from the 15 samples, with 95 DEPs obtained by comparing high and low recurrent-risk groups, including 38 upregulated and 57 downregulated proteins. Three downregulated proteins (protein S [PROS1], clusterin [CLU], and leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein 1 [LRG1]) were found to be significantly associated with poor overall survival in thyroid cancer using differential analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Immunohistochemistry results showed low or moderated expressions of PROS1, CLU, and LRG1 were significantly associated with high-risk clinicopathologic characteristics of PTC. PTC patients with higher expression of PROS1, CLU, and LRG1 had better progression-free survival than those with low or moderate expression. Our study identified PROS1, CLU, and LRG1 as novel prognostic biomarkers in PTC.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of low syncytin-1 expression on placental transport of amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol, and its implications for fetal and placental development, contributing to fetal growth restriction pathogenesis. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice received tamoxifen-induced conditional syncytin-a gene knockout at embryonic day 11.5, with controls receiving sunflower oil. Placentas and fetuses were collected analyzed for transport efficiency. Parallelly, siRNA-mediacted syncytin-1 knockdown in BeWo cells assessed trophoblast dysfunction. Nutritional content and the expression of relevant transporters for amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol, were all evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Using conditionally induced syncytin-a gene knockout mouse models, we found that syncytin-A deficiency resulted in decreased fetal and placental weights, reduced placental labyrinthine layer area and syncytiotrophoblast layer structural defects. Placental amino acid (SNAT2, LAT1), fatty acid (CD36, FABP4, FATP4), and cholesterol (LDLR, SR-B1) transporters were dysregulated, aligning with altered nutrient levels in knockout mice. Similar dysfunction in amino acid and fatty acid transport was observed in syncytin-1-silenced BeWo cells. Mechanistically, syncytin-1 deficiency suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, a key pathway modulating nutrient sensing and transporter activity. Our experiments demonstrate that syncytin-1 regulates the transport of amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol in placental trophoblastic cells, providing new insights into the pathological role of decreased syncytin-1 in pregnancy-related disorders, particularly in fetal growth restriction.",

However, its mechanisms against BPH are still unclear.\n\nThis study aims to elucidate the active fractions of H. plantaginea flower responsible for anti-BPH effects and their underlying mechanisms.\n\nThe chemical constituents in fractions of H. plantaginea flower were rapidly identified using UHPLC-MS. The anti-BPH efficacies of the effect fractions were evaluated in testosterone propionate (TP)-induced RWPE-1 cells and rat models. Metabolomics and bioinformatics analyses were used to identify potential metabolic and signaling pathways, which were validated by Western blotting.\n\nA total of 26, 38, and 23 phytochemicals were fleetly identified from petroleum ether (HPA), ethyl acetate (HPB), and butanol (HPC) fractions, respectively. The HPA, HPB, and HPC fractions of H. plantaginea flower exhibit significant anti-BPH effects at equivalent doses of the raw H. plantaginea flower herb (1 and 4 g/kg), including reductions in prostate enlargement, wet weight, and prostatic index, along with improvements in damaged prostate tissue. Additionally, these fractions significantly increased testosterone levels and decreased dihydrotestosterone, 5α-reductase, and epidermal growth factor levels in prostate tissue. In addition, HPA and HPB fractions possess anti-BPH activities in vitro. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that HPA, HPB, and HPC reversed 33 differential metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism and the regulation of AMPK/JNK pathways, as well as their downstream STAT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB pathways.

In this study, we observed that MC-LR disrupted acrosome biogenesis, a critical process for sperm function. Mechanistically, MC-LR induced proteasomal degradation of Golgi-associated PDZ- and coiled-coil motif-containing protein (GOPC), a key acrosome assembly protein, by disrupting its ubiquitin homeostasis. This degradation resulted from dual inhibition of MC-LR on the deubiquitinase ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3). MC-LR directly bound to catalytic domain of UCHL3, obstructing its interaction with GOPC and inhibiting its enzymatic activity. MC-LR was also found to suppresses UCHL3 transcription and destabilizes UCHL3 protein stability. Further studies showed that UCHL3 dysfunction triggered excessive GOPC ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction. Our study provided the first mechanistic evidence linking an environmental toxin (MC-LR) to ubiquitination-dependent failure of spermiogenesis, specifically through GOPC degradation. We identified disruption of the UCHL3-GOPC regulatory axis as a novel etiological pathway in MC-LR-induced male infertility, highlighting this axis as a promising therapeutic target for chemical-induced reproductive dysfunction.",

Protein kinases evolved in eukaryotes as important mediators of cell signalling that target specific amino acid side chains to modulate downstream protein function. Among them, the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a family of intracellular protein kinases that form signalling cascades responding to a number of stimuli, that control fundamental mechanisms such as proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death. Signals propagate through consecutive kinases which eventually phosphorylate and activate a MAPK. Here, we show that the dual specificity threonine/tyrosine MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs) are able to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs using ADP as well as ATP in vitro. As the pathways are involved in the stress response, we speculate that it would represent an advantage to be able to maintain signalling under conditions such as hypoxia, that occur under a number of cell stresses, including cancer and atherosclerosis, where the available pool of ATP could be depleted.",

Growth performance in poultry, particularly broilers, plays a critical role in production efficiency. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a multifunctional hormone which shows promotive effects on growth and development. Traditional IGF-1 delivery methods, such as injections or dietary supplements, face practical limitations including high cost, multiple dosages and rapid degradation. To explore a more efficient IGF-1 delivery method for promoting chicken growth, we generated a recombinant herpesvirus of turkey expressing chicken IGF-1, rHVT-chIGF-1. A single dose of rHVT-chIGF-1 was administered intramuscularly to broilers at day 1 of age. Growth performance parameters, including body weight (BW) and average daily weight gain (ADG) was assessed over a 42-day period. The results showed that, at both 35 and 42 days of age, the rHVT-IGF-1 group showed significantly higher BW and ADG compared to the HVT group (35d BW: p = 0.0063; 42d BW: p < 0.0001; 35d ADG: p < 0.0001; 42d ADG: p < 0.0001) and the blank control group (35d BW: p = 0.0189; 42d BW: p = 0.0032; 35d ADG: p < 0.0001; 42d ADG: p < 0.0001). The cross-sectional area (CSA) of pectoral and leg muscle fibres was significantly greater in chickens from the rHVT-chIGF-1 group compared to those in the HVT vector (p = 0.0078) and blank control (p = 0.025) groups. Additionally, the mRNA expression of muscle development-related genes was significantly upregulated in the rHVT-chIGF-1 group. These findings suggest that rHVT-chIGF-1 is a novel and effective in vivo delivery system for promoting chicken growth, offering an alternative to traditional IGF-1 delivery methods.",

The autophagic process begins by forming autophagosomes, which then merge with lysosomes to recycle degraded materials. Autophagy functions in multiple ways to affect cancer development and treatment outcomes. Tumor cells with low autophagy levels may exhibit anti-tumor effects during cancer initiation because their connection to malignant transformation is possible. The promotion of autophagy appears beneficial for cancer prevention in this context. The survival of cancer cells through increased autophagy enables tumor growth in existing tumors by allowing them to overcome metabolic and treatment-related challenges. Research indicates that blocking autophagy through the use of drugs or genetic methods makes cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies, suggesting that inhibiting the autophagic system may be a promising approach to enhance treatment. Excessive autophagy activation could be a therapeutic approach to manage cancer cells that resist cell death. The successful treatment of cancer requires an understanding of autophagy's dual nature. This review examines potential therapeutic strategies for tumors by analyzing autophagy-related signaling pathways and the essential factors that influence cancer development.",

Network pharmacology identified 78 EL-metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) overlapping targets as potential therapeutic targets of EL against mTNBC, with PPI and GMFA network enrichment uncovering key metastasis-associated pathways including Notch, TGF-β, TNF, and ErbB signaling. Molecular docking and 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations revealed stable binding of EL to several core oncogenic proteins (e.g., EGFR, PARP1, AURKB, SMAD4, CDK4), suggesting poly-pharmacological engagement. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of EL-treated cells coupled with GSEA revealed coordinated downregulation of oncogenic programs including E2F, G2/M checkpoint, MYC targets, EMT, and metabolic plasticity, alongside induction of NRF2 signaling and ferroptosis. This study reports, for the first time, transcriptome-wide effects of EL in MDA-MB-231 cells, linking its activity to the repression of stemness, invasion, and immune-evasive traits. Experimental validation via qPCR confirmed EL-mediated suppression of key molecular targets of TGF-β and Notch signaling pathways. EL also impaired cortactin expression and disrupted cytoskeletal remodeling, validated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry studies, indicating attenuation of invasive machinery. Furthermore, EL reduced metastatic dissemination in a zebrafish xenograft model, reinforcing its in vivo anti-metastatic potential. Together, our integrative study elucidates EL's multitarget mechanism against metastatic TNBC and highlights its translational promise as a systems-level modulator of oncogenic signaling. These findings warrant further in-depth mechanistic investigations to validate EL's therapeutic potential.",

    "combined_text": "The EAT-Lancet diet in relation nutrient intake among older adults: insights from the Gothenburg H70 birth cohort study.\n\nThe EAT-Lancet Commission has proposed a global reference diet aimed at promoting both human health and environmental sustainability. While adherence to this dietary pattern has been associated with reduced risks of chronic disease and lower environmental impact, concerns remain about its ability to meet nutritional requirements - particularly among older adults. The aim was to explore the association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and nutrient intake and adequacy among 70-year-old adults in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nThis cross-sectional study included 861 participants from the Swedish population-based Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study (mean age 70.5 years, 55% women). Dietary intake was assessed using a validated diet history interview, and adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was scored based on 14 food components. Nutrient intake was evaluated against age- and sex-specific recommended intake (RI) levels. Cardiometabolic risk markers and biomarkers of nutritional status, including homocysteine and haemoglobin, were measured. Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine trends across sex-specific tertiles of diet adherence, with sensitivity analyses adjusting for energy intake and comparing adequacy based on average requirement (AR) thresholds.\n\nHigher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was linked to higher intake of fibre and polyunsaturated fats, and lower intake of saturated fat and alcohol. Mean protein intake per kilogram body weight/day was similar across adherence tertiles. Intake of beta-carotene, folate, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and iron was higher with greater adherence, while retinol equivalents, vitamin B12, niacin equivalents was lower- patterns that remained consistent after energy adjustment. Despite lower B12 intake, homocysteine levels were lowest in the group with highest adherence, and anaemia prevalence did not differ. Micronutrient adequacy improved with higher adherence for vitamin E, folate, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and iron. Similar results were observed using average requirement (AR) thresholds in sensitivity analyses.\n\nAdherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was associated with a more favourable nutrient profile in this cohort of older adults, without evidence of widespread micronutrient inadequacy. These findings suggest that environmentally sustainable diets can support adequate nutrition when well-balanced, even in nutritionally vulnerable populations such as older adults.",

Understanding the dynamics of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in septic patients, particularly those with AKI, could improve the monitoring and prediction of renal outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate fluctuations in oxidative stress and antioxidant capacities in septic patients with and without AKI at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and one week later. In addition, it sought to investigate the potential correlation between specific oxidative stress and antioxidant markers and renal outcomes.\n\nA cross-sectional and follow-up study was conducted, involving 124 critically ill septic patients. The patients were divided into groups according to the presence of AKI at admission to the ICU. Epidemiological, clinical data, and biochemical measurements of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity were collected on days 1 and 7 of ICU admission.\n\nThe results indicated that plasma concentrations of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were significantly higher in patients with AKI on both evaluation days. Notable differences in antioxidant capacities, including plasma glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase, were observed between the two groups. In patients with AKI, plasma oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity demonstrated a close relationship. Specifically, plasma GSH concentrations on day 1 were correlated with increased odds of major adverse kidney events within 14 and 28 days (MAKE14 and MAKE28), while elevated plasma GPx activities on day 7 were associated with reduced odds of MAKE14 and MAKE28.\n\nMonitoring plasma GSH concentrations on the 1st day of ICU admission, in conjunction with the evaluation of plasma GPx activities on the 7th day, may serve as pivotal indicators for predicting renal outcomes in critically septic patients.",

Salt-extracted protein isolates had lower glucosinolate (0.47 μmol/g) and phytic acid (0.59 %) content than the alkaline-extracted protein isolates, whereas the alkaline-extracted isolates demonstrated higher digestibility (93 %). The inconsistency between the trend of non-protein anti-nutritional factors and protein digestibility suggests that protein composition may play a more significant role than anti-nutritional factors. Proteomic analysis showed that both extraction methods yielded similar globulin (cruciferin) abundance, but the salt-extracted isolate contained more protein anti-nutritional factors, including albumin (napin) and other protease inhibitors.

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of plant-based proteins on recovery from resistance exercise-induced muscle damage in healthy young adults.\n\nA systematic and comprehensive search was administered in eight databases up to 1 May 2025, identifying 1407 articles. Following deduplication and screening, 24 studies met the eligibility criteria, including 22 randomized controlled trials and 2 non-randomized studies, with the majority from high income western countries.\n\nInterventions primarily involved soy, pea, rice, hemp, potato, and blended plant protein sources, with doses ranging from 15 to 50 g, typically administered post resistance exercise. Outcomes assessed included muscle protein synthesis (MPS), delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), inflammatory biomarkers, muscle function, and fatigue. The review findings reaffirm that single-source plant proteins generally offer limited benefits compared to animal proteins such as whey, particularly in acute recovery settings, a limitation well-documented consistently in the literature. However, our synthesis highlights that well-formulated plant protein blends (e.g., combinations of pea, rice, and canola) can stimulate MPS at levels comparable to whey when consumed at adequate doses (≥30 g with ~2.5 g leucine). Some studies also reported improvements in subjective recovery outcomes and reductions in muscle damage biomarkers with soy or pea protein. However, overall evidence remains limited by small sample sizes, moderate to high risk of bias, and heterogeneity in intervention protocols, protein formulations, and outcome measures. Risk of bias assessments revealed concerns related to detection and reporting bias in nearly half the studies. Due to clinical and methodological variability, a meta-analysis was not conducted.\n\nplant-based proteins particularly in the form of protein blends and when dosed appropriately, may support muscle recovery in resistance-trained individuals and offer a viable alternative to animal-based proteins. However, further high-quality, long-term trials in vegan populations are needed to establish definitive recommendations for plant protein use in sports nutrition.",

ABA signaling leads to a phospho-regulatory cascade involving the PP2C phosphatase ABI1 (PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C ABA INSENSITIVE 1) and kinase CIPK23 (CBL INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 23). ABI1 is inactivated by ABA, releasing the kinase CIPK23 to phosphorylate and inactivate AMT1 (AMMONIUM TRANSPORTER 1) transporters. To date, it was unclear whether this effective mechanism to prevent ammonium toxicity relies on various ABA sensors and general signaling or whether a specific ABA sensor is involved in this regulation. Here, we show that ammonium stress specifically induces the expression of a subset of PYL (PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1 - LIKE) ABA receptors, including PYL8. PYL8 is known to preferably bind and regulate the PP2C phosphatase AIP1 (AKT1 INTERACTING PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1). Addressing the upregulated PYLs, only a pyl8 mutant showed an increased sensitivity to high ammonium concentrations and a growth retardation in the response to high external ammonium conditions. Correspondingly, aip1 mutants showed a lower sensitivity and a delay in AMT1 reactivation. While AMT1 inactivation appears to be a general mechanism regulated by ABI1 and several PYLs, the function of AIP1 and PYL8 seems to be the regulation of AMT1 reactivation.",

    "combined_text": "The acute changes in intracellular amino acid production during sepsis do not relate to plasma concentrations.\n\nIt remains unclear how amino acid metabolism is altered during the early phase of sepsis. We therefore investigated the acute changes in amino acid metabolism during sepsis in a pig model. We studied 51 pigs using a pulse stable isotope tracer method to measure kinetic changes in almost all amino acids before and 6.5 h after sepsis induction by continuous infusion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Statistics were done by Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Sepsis induced only small (<10 %) changes in plasma concentration of amino acids, while amino acid clearance was substantially increased for amino acids like taurine (+33 %), histidine (+42 %), glycine (+35 %), glutamine (+27 %), arginine (+13 %) and citrulline (+20 %), while reduced for tyrosine (-11 %), threonine (-11 %), lysine (-14 %). Compartmental analysis revealed that changes in extra- and intracellular amino acid pools and fluxes were much larger than the changes in plasma concentrations. Intracellular pool sizes were substantially lower for glutamate (-47 %), lysine (-46 %), phenylalanine (-39 %), threonine (-33 %), and tyrosine (-28 %) and higher for taurine (+21 %), hydroxyproline (+31 %) and glutamine (+35 %). Notably, intracellular productions of essential amino acids like lysine (-49 %), phenylalanine (-25 %), threonine (-26 %), tryptophan (-22 %), and tyrosine (-22 %) were significantly reduced during sepsis, while those of taurine (+24 %) and glutamine (+34 %) were increased, suggesting attenuated protein breakdown in the early phase of sepsis. Plasma cytokine levels, including IL1-beta (+50 %), IL1-ra (+120 %), IL6 (+26 %), and TNF-alpha (+9 %), were also statistically significantly elevated. Large changes in intracellular amino acid metabolism occur relatively quickly during the development of sepsis, while changes in plasma concentration are small. Therefore, compartmental analysis of amino acid metabolism shows that changes in the extra- and intracellular pools and fluxes into these pools seems to precede the changes in plasma concentrations, indicating that amino acid metabolism is affected much more and sooner than could be concluded from measuring plasma concentrations only.",

Traditional methods rely on Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks and limited biological feature data, often neglecting the critical role of protein amino acid sequences. To address this, we propose the HCNS model, which integrates the Hypergraph Convolutional Network (HGCN) module, the Seq-CNN-MB-NAG feature extraction module, and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) recognition module, significantly enhancing the accuracy of essential protein identification. The HGCN module constructs a hypergraph from the PPI network and protein complex data, capturing the complex structural relationships between proteins. The Seq-CNN-MB-NAG module utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and NAG Transformer to process protein amino acid sequences and extract sequence features. The MLP module then fuses these two sets of features for precise recognition. Experimental results show that the HCNS model outperforms existing methods, achieving an accuracy of 93.38%, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.33% and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR) of 97.16%, demonstrating its potential in essential protein identification.",

To address this, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the potential response mechanisms in tilapia subjected to both factors. Tilapia were fed normal (NC) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 90 days, then challenged with S. agalactiae. At 48 h post-infection, blood, liver, and spleen samples were collected for biochemical parameter analysis and gene expression profiling. The results indicated that the combined treatment upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (pparα) and fatty acid transport protein 1 (fatp1). Concurrently, it increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (hmgcr) expression, while decreasing cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (cyp7a1) expression compared to HFD alone. Antioxidant status analysis revealed that the combined treatment decreased glutathione (GSH) content, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (nqo1), and glutathione peroxidase 3 (gpx3). Intriguingly, while both individual stressors upregulated inflammatory and immune-related genes, their combination suppressed interleukin-1β (il-1β), il-8, and immunoglobulin M (igm) expression compared to infection alone. The apoptotic response triggered by S. agalactiae infection, characterized by elevated caspase-3 (cas3), cas9, and cytochrome c (cytc), was inhibited in the liver of combined treatment group. Moreover, all experimental groups showed elevated expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (ire1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (eif2ak3), activating transcription factor 6 (atf6), and binding immunoglobulin protein (bip). These findings collectively demonstrated that HFD exacerbated the pathogenic effects of S. agalactiae through multiple mechanisms, including metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress potentiation, and complex immunomodulation. Furthermore, the Nrf2 and NF-kB signaling pathways may be implicated in mediating these adverse effects.",

Compared with single-frequency ultrasound (SFU), multiple-frequency ultrasound with dual frequency (DFU) and triple-frequency (TFU) dramatically improved the functional characteristics of SPI.

Correlation analysis revealed that these changes in SPI molecular structure are the critical factors in enhancing its functional properties. Moreover, DFUG improved the nutritional values of SPI via regulating the amino acid composition and gastrointestinal digestibility.

A total of 400 birds (200 Beldi and 200 ROSS) were reared either in intensive (10 birds/m², commercial diet) or extensive rearing systems (4 birds/m², outdoor foraging). ROSS chickens reared intensively were slaughtered at 4, 5, and 6 weeks, whereas the other experimental groups were slaughtered at 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Physico-chemical composition (dry matter, crude protein, ash , and fat content, and fatty acid (FA) profile, pH, cooking loss, color, and tenderness) were analyzed. Each experimental group included 100 birds, which were further divided into two subgroups of 50 birds each, serving as biological replicates. Data were analyzed using a mixed linear model with repeated measures on muscles. Subgroup-level analyses showed no significant differences, allowing data to be pooled for group-level comparisons. Results showed that Beldi chickens exhibited higher dry matter (28.25 vs. 25.48 %; p < 0.001) and crude protein (24.20 vs. 18.86 % FM; p < 0.001), but lower fat content (1.77 ± 0.10 % vs. 1.92 ± 0.09 % FM; p < 0.001) than ROSS chickens. Particularly in the extensive system and at later slaughter ages, Beldi chickens exhibited higher pH values across both the breast and thigh and firmer meat with higher shear force values. Under the intensive system, chicken meat was characterized by higher tenderness, lightness (L*), and yellowness (b*), but reduced redness (a*) and cooking loss, compared to the extensive system. The fatty acid (FA) profile also varied according to these factors, with meat from Beldi chickens characterized as healthier with lower SFA and MUFA content, but higher PUFA content. Moreover, according to health indices, Beldi chickens were characterized by higher PUFA/SFA, desirable fatty acids (DFA), essential fatty acids (EFA), and LA/ALA, and a lower thrombogenic index (TI) than ROSS chickens. Meat from the extensive system was characterized by higher total SFA and MUFA and lower PUFA. In summary, Beldi chickens, particularly when reared under extensive systems, produced meat with enhanced nutritional quality, whereas ROSS broilers provided more tender meat.

In vitro, treatment with 5 mM fructose increased the size of intestinal organoids from broilers (P < 0.05). For in vivo trial, 96 one-day-old male AA broilers with similar body weights were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups (control and fructose) with 6 replicates of 8 birds each. All birds received the same commercial diet, with the control group receiving tap water and the fructose group receiving 1 % fructose in water for 42 days. Fructose supplementation had no effects on body weight, feed intake or FCR throughout the trial (P > 0.05). It increased the dressed percentage of the broilers (P < 0.05), without affecting other carcass characteristics or abdominal fat index. Apparent digestibility of dietary crude fat was reduced by fructose (P < 0.05), while crude protein digestibility remained unchanged (P > 0.05). However, fructose enhanced hepatic lipids synthesis, as evidenced by upregulated expression of ACC1 and Srebf1 (P < 0.05) and suppressed fatty acids oxidation through reduced CPT1 expression and lower serum palmitoylcarnitine levels (P < 0.05). Liver inflammation was also increased, indicated by elevated expression of IL-1β and higher serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators such as 5-HETE (P < 0.05). Fructose improved intestinal morphology, including increased villus height to crypt depth ratio and lengthening of the duodenum and ileum (P < 0.05). Tight junction gene expression was also upregulated, indicating enhanced barrier integrity. Fructose influenced the intestinal microbiota and serum metabolites of broilers. Gut microbiota composition was altered by fructose, as shown by significant differences in microbial structure (ANOSIM, P < 0.05). Fructose reduced the relative abundance of Firmicutes while increasing Bacteroidota, resulting in a lower Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidota ratio (P < 0.05). Enrichment analysis showed fructose-associated bacteria were positively correlated with intestinal morphology, while control-associated taxa were linked to fat metabolism. Serum metabolomics analysis revealed distinct clustering between groups, with differentially abundant metabolites (VIP > 1, P < 0.05) enriched in lipid metabolic pathways. In conclusion, supplementation with 1% fructose via drinking water enhanced intestinal development and microbial composition in broilers without affecting growth performance. However, it reduced dietary fat digestibility and induced hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation. These findings suggest the need for further research to optimize its use for promoting gut health without compromising liver function or nutrient utilization.",

This study investigates the mechanisms regulating extracellular adenosine levels in gastric cancer stem-like cells (GCSCs) derived from the MKN-74 cell line. Our results show that GCSCs release more ATP into the extracellular medium and exhibit higher levels of CD39 expression, which enables them to hydrolyze a greater amount of ATP. Furthermore, we also found that GCSCs possess a greater capacity to hydrolyze AMP, primarily due to the activity of the CD73 protein, with no significant changes in CD73 transcripts and protein levels between GCSCs and differentiated cells. Additionally, adenosine transport is primarily mediated by members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family in GCSCs, where a significant increase in the expression level of the ENT2 protein is observed compared to non-GCSCs MKN-74 cells. These findings suggest that targeting the adenosine metabolism pathway in GCSCs could be a potential therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.",

This study combined molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to investigate hotspot residues and epitopes of goat α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG).

Exp. 1 identified the effective concentrations of inhibitors or agonists for ERK, JNK and PI3K/AKT, the data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. In Exp. 2, a randomized factorial design consisting of 3 controls + 3 cell types × 3 Zn treatments was used to confirm the effect of Zn and cell type on each signaling pathway. Under heat stress (HT, 44℃), 3 cell types in which the signaling pathways were normal, inhibited, or over expressed were subjected to 3 treatments consisting of supplementation with inorganic Zn sulfate (iZn), organic Zn proteinate (oZn), or no Zn supplementation (containing 3.98 μmol Zn/L). Under normal temperature (NT, 40℃), the 3 cell types without Zn addition as controls. The significant differences between NT and HT across each cell type were conducted by T-test, data under HT were evaluated using two-way ANOVA. The results showed that TS decreased transepithelial resistance (TEER), claudin-1 and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNA levels, phosphorylated (p)-ERK/ERK, p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT levels, and increased phenol red permeability compared with NT in 3 cell types (P < 0.05).

While waxy endosperms arising from non-functional waxy (wx) allele leading to the absence of Granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) enzyme have been identified in sorghum, their broader effects on seed development and grain quality remain inadequately understood. To address this gap, we identified a novel wx loss-of-function allele, \"wxe\" in the mutant population of the sorghum reference genome line BTx623. Beyond reduced amylose content, wxe exhibited increased kernel hardness, elevated protein content, reduced endosperm-to-germ ratio, and decreased kernel weight compared to the wild-type. Integrating transcriptomic, metabolomic, and seed chemistry analyses revealed coordinated regulatory changes during seed development due to disrupted amylose synthesis. This included altered starch granule structure, enhanced lipid profiles, and reduced carbohydrate content. Differentially expressed genes and transcription factors related to starch metabolism provided insights into the regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, metabolic profiling showed significant changes in the accumulation of compounds influencing flavor and nutritional properties. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular coordination of sorghum seed development and provides new insights into regulating seed development.",

Currently, research on the ghrelin is primarily focused on a single species, and there have been no systematic studies on the evolution of the ghrelin in fish. Therefore, this thesis conducts a comprehensive analysis of the ghrelin gene in 151 species of ray-finned bony fishes to reveal the universality and specificity of the ghrelin gene in the evolutionary history of fish, supplementing and perfecting the information on the ghrelin gene in Actinopterygii. The gene identification results show that the number of ghrelin genes varies among different fish species, 41 fish have lost the ghrelin gene, 98 fish having one ghrelin gene, and 12 fish having two ghrelin genes. Among the 110 fish species with the ghrelin gene, a total of 182 ghrelin gene sequences were identified, with transcript variant numbers ranging from 1 to 6, encoding 1 to 3 types of isoform proteins, and their mature peptides show a certain degree of similarity across different species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that teleost ghrelin proteins segregate into three major evolutionary clades, with Salmoniformes orthologs comprising a distinct monophyletic cluster. The Cladistic and Chondrostei are clustered separately and then grouped with the more ancient Cypriniformes and Siluriformes species from the Neopterygii into a large group, while the other fish species from the Neopterygii form another large group. The Synteny analysis results indicate that the upstream gene of the ghrelin is CCDC174, and the downstream gene is TATDN2. The selection pressure analysis results show that there are no positive selection sites in the ghrelin gene, indicating that the ghrelin has been under strong functional constraint during the evolutionary process of fish. This study systematically investigates the evolutionary history of fish ghrelin, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the function and status of ghrelin in the feeding regulation system of fish, and deepening the recognition of its structural and functional evolution in the process of energy metabolism evolution.",

Different WPI/MBP ratios (100/0 to 0/100) were investigated for gel properties, stability, and DHQ bioaccessibility. Increasing WPI enhanced gel elasticity, water holding capacity, viscosity, and network density. The 80/20 ratio showed the highest DHQ retention (75 % after 24 h UV exposure), bioaccessibility (25 %), and transformation efficiency (67.86 %). As WPI content increased, disulfide bonds became the main force for gel formation, followed by hydrophobic interactions. The antioxidant capacity improved after digestion, with a DPPH scavenging rate over 90 %. These results highlight the potential of the WPI-MBP system for hydrophobic compound delivery and DHQ application in the food industry.",

This study developed a novel approach to identify digestion-resistant antigenic epitopes of BLG and ALA through simulated in vitro infant digestion. A peptidomics approach based on mass spectrometry, combined with high-throughput molecular docking, was employed to predict peptide interactions with the IgE fragment of antigen binding. Seven antigenic epitopes and 22 key amino acids were identified from BLG-derived peptides, and five antigenic epitopes and 18 key amino acids were identified from ALA-derived peptides. The allergenicity of synthetic epitopes ranged from 40 % to 80 %, and the dissociation constant between epitopes and IgE ranged from 17.90 nM to 279.01 nM, confirming their strong IgE-binding potential.

Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis identified more pronounced transcriptomic changes under chronic HS (heart: 2,503 DEGs; liver: 2,236 DEGs) compared to acute HS (heart: 1,217 DEGs; liver: 1,843 DEGs).

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) highlighted stress-duration-dependent modules, with liver modules linked to metabolism and heart modules to immune and redox regulation. Temporal clustering revealed dynamic expression shifts, with chronic HS enhancing protein chaperone activity and acute HS triggering rapid signaling adjustments.

Among them, sarcopenia is a metabolic disorder characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. The two age-related diseases, DM and sarcopenia, share underlying pathophysiological pathways. This narrative literature review aims to provide an overview of the existing evidence on metabolomic studies evaluating DM associated with sarcopenia. Advancements in targeted and untargeted metabolomics techniques could provide better insight into the pathogenesis of sarcopenia in DM and describe their entangled and fluctuating interrelationship. Recent evidence showed that sarcopenia in DM induced significant changes in protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and in energy metabolisms in humans, animal models of DM, and cell cultures. Newer metabolites were reported, known metabolites were also found significantly modified, while few amino acids and lipids displayed a dual behavior. In addition, several therapeutic approaches proved to be promising interventions for slowing the progression of sarcopenia in DM, including physical activity, newer antihyperglycemic classes, D-pinitol, and genetic USP21 ablation, although none of them were yet validated for clinical use. Conversely, ceramides had a negative impact. Further research is needed to confirm the utility of these findings and to provide potential metabolomic biomarkers that might be relevant for the pathogenesis and treatment of sarcopenia in DM.",

    "combined_text": "Plant-protein isolates and flavour perception: Understanding mechanisms and strategies to balance flavour retention and release.\n\nThe incorporation of plant-based protein isolates (PPI) into food is steadily increasing. However, due to their structure and functional properties, proteins can interact with flavour compounds, influencing their volatility, release, and overall sensory profile. This review examines their interaction with flavour compounds, highlighting the effect of chemical bonding and processing factors on altering protein binding sites and flavour perception. A key challenge with PPI is the presence of negative flavours, like beany and bitter, which can limit its application in food formulation. Protein-focused strategies for mitigating these undesirable flavours are also discussed. While most research has focused on model systems using PPI solutions, studies incorporating PPI within food matrices have also been included where possible, to provide an authentic understanding of flavours in formulated products. By integrating current findings from both analytical and sensory studies, this review aims to outline PPI's role in improving flavour quality in food development.",

    "combined_text": "Crossing barriers? Longitudinal evaluation of intestinal permeability in adolescent anorexia nervosa.\n\nAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe eating disorder with significant somatic complications, potentially involving an altered intestinal barrier. Prior studies yielded heterogeneous results, ranging from decreased to increased intestinal permeability in AN. This study aimed to assess intestinal permeability in adolescent patients with AN by comparing serum markers Zonulin, Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and intestinal Fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP) with healthy controls (HC) over time.\n\nWe conducted a longitudinal study on 60 female adolescent patients with AN and 36 age-matched HC. Blood samples were collected at admission to inpatient treatment, at discharge, and at a one-year follow-up. Zonulin, LBP, iFABP and inflammation marker Interleukin 6 levels were measured alongside clinical parameters. Linear mixed models were applied to assess group differences and longitudinal changes. Pearson correlations were used to explore clinical associations.\n\nZonulin levels were significantly decreased in the AN group at admission and again at the follow-up compared to HC. LBP levels were consistently reduced in AN across all three time points. These alterations thus persisted despite weight recovery. No significant differences were observed in iFABP levels between the groups or over time. Zonulin and LBP positively correlated with Interleukin 6, linking gut permeability to inflammatory processes.\n\nDecreased Zonulin and LBP levels suggest reduced paracellular intestinal permeability in adolescent AN while transcellular permeability (iFABP) appears to be rather unaffected. The persistence of these alterations despite weight recovery suggests that reduced intestinal permeability may be a trait rather than a state marker in AN. Our findings challenge the concept of a \"leaky gut\" in adolescent AN.This highlights the need for further research on the intestinal barrier in AN, while also integrating the role of nutritional intake, gut microbiome interaction and immune reactions, to support the development of gut-targeted therapies.",

With an average egg production of 40 eggs per season and yielding 58.59% carcass on live weight, ostriches offer substantial economic benefits. The nutritional needs of ostriches evolve across different life stages, impacting growth and reproductive performance. As herbivores capable of digesting high-fiber diets, ostriches thrive on roughage and pasture, with a digestive system similar to other poultry. Essential nutrients, including 20-24% crude protein (CP) and 12-19% crude fiber, are critical for optimal development, particularly in early growth, where their feed conversion ratio is 2:1. As ostriches reach sexual maturity, maintaining a diet rich in amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrates becomes vital for optimizing fertility and reproductive performance. This review provides a detailed overview of ostrich nutrient requirements across different growth stages, focusing on how energy and protein levels affect overall growth and productivity. It also explores the importance of feeding management practices in enhancing ostrich health and performance, offering insights for improving commercial ostrich farming.",

Three influential online open databases (UniProt, AlzGene, and Allen Human Brain Atlas) were explored to identify the genes and encoded proteins involved in AD linked to mitochondrial and iron dysmetabolism. The databases were searched using specific keywords to collect information about protein composition, and function, and meta-analysis data about their correlation with AD. The extracted datasets were matched to yield a list of relevant proteins in AD. The biochemical analysis of their amino acid content suggested a defective synthesis of these proteins in poorly oxygenated brain tissue, supporting their relevance in AD progression.

This study investigated post-inflection-point growth patterns in two genetically distinct pig breeds-the lean-type Yorkshire pig (YP) and the fatty-type Qingyu pig (QYP)-with the aim of elucidating breed-specific characteristics that influence pork quality and yield. Comprehensive evaluations of carcass traits, meat quality attributes, nutritional composition, and gene expression profiles were conducted. After the growth inflection point, carcass traits exhibited greater variability than meat quality traits in both breeds, though with distinct patterns. YPs displayed superior muscle development, with the longissimus muscle area (LMA) increasing rapidly before plateauing at ~130 kg, whereas QYPs maintained more gradual but sustained muscle growth. In contrast, intramuscular fat (IMF)-a key determinant of meat flavor and texture-accumulated faster in YPs post inflection but plateaued earlier in QYPs. Correlation and clustering analyses revealed more synchronized regulation of meat quality traits in QYPs, while YPs showed greater trait variability. Gene expression patterns aligned with these phenotypic trends, highlighting distinct regulatory mechanisms for muscle and fat development in each breed. In addition, based on the growth curves, we calculated the peak age at which the growth rate declined in lean-type and fat-type pigs, which was approximately 200 days for YPs and around 270 days for QYPs. This suggests that these ages may represent the optimal slaughter times for the respective breeds, balancing both economic efficiency and meat quality. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing pork quality through precision management and offer theoretical guidance for developing breed-specific feeding strategies, slaughter timing, and value-added pork production tailored to consumer preferences in the modern food market.",

Participants were recruited via consecutive sampling and randomly assigned to receive synbiotics (comprising 4 probiotic strains and 1 prebiotic) or placebo daily for 42 days. Inflammatory status was assessed through the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Fat and muscle mass were measured using a Karada Scan Omron. Anorexia was evaluated with the FAACT-A/CS questionnaire, and fatigue with the FACIT-F questionnaire. Functional capacity was determined through hand grip strength (HGS) using a Camry dynamometer. Data were collected pre and post-intervention and analyzed using an independent t-test (or Mann-Whitney test) for continuous data and chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) for categorical data.

Although emerging evidence suggests that l-leucine and β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate (HMB) have potential for treating CAC, the role of α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), a metabolite of l-leucine, remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the use of KIC as a therapeutic agent for CAC-induced muscle atrophy by targeting myostatin.\n\nWe evaluated the effect of KIC on muscle atrophy using BALB/c mice and C2C12 myotubes as models of C26- and 4T1-induced CAC. Male and female mice were injected with C26 and 4T1 cells, respectively. Grip strength was measured weekly, and mice were sacrificed 4 weeks post-injection for muscle collection. C2C12 myotubes were treated with conditioned media (CM) derived from C26 or 4T1 cells.\n\nKIC suppressed mRNA expression of myostatin, a key regulator of muscle atrophy, more effectively than did l-leucine (-26.37 ± 4.11%, p < 0.01). KIC enhanced protein turnover in C2C12 myotubes and maintained 50% cell viability at high concentrations (KIC: 4.68 mM, HMB: 3.11 mM). Following CM treatment, KIC suppressed MuRF1 and MAFbx expression in a myostatin-dependent manner, thereby reducing their polyubiquitination. KIC restored Akt-FoxO3a phosphorylation, leading to improved myotube diameter (+63.8 ± 25.71%, p < 0.05) and fusion index (+51.9 ± 22.6%, p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence and nuclear fractionation revealed that KIC reduced FoxO3a nuclear accumulation. CM reduced p-Akt-FoxO3a interaction, which was rescued by KIC. In vivo, KIC administration increased body weight (11.11 ± 8.53%), grip strength (24.76 ± 10.58%), and skeletal muscle mass (p < 0.001) in C26 tumour-bearing mice. Protein expression of myostatin in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (-23.57 ± 12.22%, p < 0.05) and serum (-52.11 ± 3.56%, p < 0.001) was lower in KIC-treated mice (n = 12) compared with that in the controls.

Serum myostatin levels (-57.43 ± 9.46%, p < 0.001) and skeletal muscle weight were reduced in KIC-treated mice (n = 10).\n\nOur findings demonstrate that KIC improves muscle function in CAC-induced muscle atrophy by regulating myostatin expression in skeletal muscle via the Akt-FoxO3a pathway.

However, its potential anti-sarcopenic effects remain unclear. This study examined the effects of yuja peel hot water extract (YW) on dexamethasone (DEX)-induced muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotubes and sarcopenic mouse model.\n\nWe measured grip strength, cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber, biochemical markers, and expression of muscle-specific messenger RNA and proteins in atrophied muscle cell/tissue after treatment with YW.\n\nIn DEX-treated C2C12 cells, YW (100 and 200 µg/mL) increased the diameter of myotubes and reduced the gene and protein expression of muscle-specific F-box protein (atrogin-1) and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) compared to the DEX (100 µM). In the mouse model with DEX (10 mg/kg)-induced muscle atrophy, treatment with YW (200 mg/kg/day) significantly increased grip strength and the cross-sectional area of the gastrocnemius muscle fibers, whereas it decreased serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase levels compared to the DEX group. Treatment with YW downregulated the proteins related to muscle degradation, such as atrogin-1, MuRF-1, ubiquitin, and growth differentiation factor 8 (myostatin), by regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-forkhead box O3 alpha (FoxO3α) pathway. Furthermore, treatment with YW upregulated the proteins associated with muscle protein synthesis, such as myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD1), myogenin (MyoG), and myosin heavy chain (MHC), by regulating the PI3K-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. A puromycin labeling assay in C2C12 myotube cells showed that YW treatment significantly increased protein synthesis compared to the cells treated with DEX alone. YW significantly upregulated the protein expression of phosphorylated PI3K and Akt in wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor)-treated C2C12 cells.\n\nYW suppressed DEX-induced muscle atrophy by regulating the PI3K-Akt-mTOR/FoxO3α signaling pathway. These results indicate that YW may serve as a potential agent for the treatment or prevention of muscle atrophy.",

Its compatibility with other biopolymers, such as milk proteins, and its ability to form standalone cryogels allow it to be utilized for the fabrication of films with improved properties for applications in the food and biomedical-pharmaceutical industries. In the present work, the properties of kefiran films were investigated in the presence of milk proteins (sodium caseinate, native and heat-treated whey proteins, and their mixtures), alongside glycerol (as a plasticizer) and cryo-treatment of the film-forming solution prior to drying. A total of 24 kefiran films were fabricated and studied for their physical (thickness, moisture content, water solubility, color parameters and vapor adsorption), mechanical (tensile strength and elongation at break), and optical properties. Milk proteins increased film thickness, solubility and tensile strength and reduced water vapor adsorption. The hygroscopic effect of glycerol was mitigated in the presence of milk proteins and/or the application of cryo-treatment. Glycerol was the most effective at reducing the films' opacity. Heat treatment of whey proteins proved to be the most effective in increasing film tensile strength, reducing, at the same time, the elongation at break, while sodium caseinates in combination with cryo-treatment resulted in films with high tensile strength and the highest elongation at break. Cryo-treatment, carried out in the present study through freezing followed by gradual thawing of the film-forming solution, proved to be the most effective factor in decreasing film roughness. Based on our results, proper selection of the film-forming solution composition and its treatment prior to drying can result in kefiran-glycerol films with favorable properties for particular applications.",

Results revealed that HT influenced serum glucose and gamma-glutamyl transferase, histological inflammation, and active behaviors. HT modified lipid profiles, reduced capric, lauric, linolenic, arachidonic, cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic fatty acid concentrations, and increased the nervonic acid profile. The digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, energy, and protein increased with HT use up to 50 mg/kg of feed.

Here, we designed a CRISPR library targeting 661 mitochondrial proteins and identified the MPC (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier) as a critical regulator of hPSC self-renewal and pluripotency. Notably, MPC inhibition reduced hPSC self-renewal and endoderm differentiation while promoting mesoderm differentiation, with no effect on ectoderm differentiation, all mediated by influencing glycolytic acetyl-CoA production. Specifically, the decrease in acetyl-CoA following MPC inhibition affected histone acetylation in hPSCs, compromising self-renewal. In contrast, MPC inhibition did not impact histone acetylation in differentiated cells; instead, it reduced the acetylation of non-histone proteins-EP300 and SMAD2-thereby enhancing mesoderm differentiation and repressing endoderm differentiation, respectively. These findings suggest that distinct effector proteins respond to variations in acetyl-CoA levels at different developmental stages, leading to a context-dependent regulation of cell fate determination by glycolytic acetyl-CoA in hPSCs.",

Inflammation resulting from the dynamic imbalance of macrophage polarization and the injury of podocytes caused by lipid accumulation together drives the disease process. This study aims to explore the mechanism of TP alleviating aging with DKD via macrophage polarization and podocyte lipid accumulation. Initially, aging with DKD model rats were treated with or without TP (75, 150, 300 mg/kg once daily, ig) for 8 weeks; lipid accumulation in podocytes, inflammatory cytokines in serum and kidney, and macrophage phenotype in kidney were detected. We found silencing information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a key protein of cell senescence; its activation contributes to the transition of macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most important monomeric compound of TP, has been found to stably bind to SIRT1 by molecular docking experiment. Furthermore, an indirect co-culture system of RAW264.7 and MPC5 cells was constructed to investigate the effect of EGCG on the targeted macrophage polarization, ameliorating podocyte lipid accumulation. The agonist and inhibitor of SIRT1 were used to validate through immunofluorescence analysis, Oil Red O staining, lipid-related protein analysis, and phalloidin marking. We demonstrated that TP promotes SIRT1 activation, thereby enhancing the transformation of macrophages into the M2 phenotype, reducing renal inflammation, and ultimately alleviating podocyte lipid accumulation.

The design of the drying experiments, which shows the relationship between the input and output variables, was conducted by the response surface method (RSM). The results showed that decreasing irradiation distance, increasing air temperature, and sonication time led to decreasing drying time and specific energy consumption (SEC). The minimum and maximum total color changes were 13.37 and 29.57, respectively. The changes in rehydration ratio (RR) of the samples increased with increasing temperature and sonication time but decreased with increasing irradiation distance, while the results were opposite for ash. The highest amount of protein and the lowest amount of fat were obtained at 70°C temperature, sonication time (30 min), and irradiation distance (15 cm), respectively. The best conditions for drying yellow mealworm include the use a temperature of 70°C, a sonication time of 25.95 min, and an irradiation distance of 11.32 cm, and by applying the optimal conditions for drying time, SEC, color, RR, fat, protein, and ash of the produced dry yellow mealworm are equal to 171.22 min, 61.45 MJ/kg, 14.28, 1.83, 29.09%, 48.13%, and 3.79%, respectively.

In this study, the anti-sarcopenia effect of the whey protein isolate-epigallocatechin gallate (WPI-EGCG) complex and its underlying mechanisms were investigated using a D-galactose induced senescence C2C12 cell model and skeletal muscle sarcopenia mouse model. The results showed that the optimal preparation conditions of the complex were pH 5.5, reaction time 1.5 h, and WPI:EGCG = 1:2.5. Under this condition, the DPPH free radical scavenging rate of the complex was 71.61%, and the protein digestibility was 80.95%. Compared with WPI, the antioxidant activity of the complex was significantly increased by 66.23%, and the protein digestibility was significantly decreased by 5.39% (p < 0.05). After the intervention with 0.32 mol/L and 0.16 mol/L D-galactose, the cell proliferation rate of 4.0 mg/mL WPI-EGCG complex treatment was significantly increased by 63.81% and 69.92% compared with the model group (p < 0.05), respectively. In addition, gavage of a low dose WPI-EGCG complex (250 mg/kg/d.bw) significantly increased skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and muscle cross-sectional area (p < 0.05), and improved muscle mass and muscle fiber morphology in the sarcopenia mouse model compared with the model group. Compared with the model group, the low-dose WPI-EGCG complex significantly increased SOD activity by 16.14% and decreased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) content by 17.18% (p < 0.05), which was beneficial to reduce the oxidative stress level of mice. In addition, the protein expression of PI3K was increased after gavage of a low dose WPI-EGCG complex compared with the model group. After gavage of a high dose of the WPI-EGCG complex, the expression of AKT and mTOR protein was significantly increased compared with the model group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the WPI-EGCG complex ameliorated the inhibitory effect of D-galactose on protein synthesis in mouse skeletal muscle by up-regulating the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR proteins.

This study reviews the impact of sarcopenia in COPD and evaluates effective therapeutic strategies. Findings suggest that pulmonary rehabilitation, combined with aerobic and resistance exercises, and supplemented with protein and vitamin D, enhances muscle function and reduces the prevalence of sarcopenia. Additionally, emerging interventions such as inspiratory muscle training, myostatin inhibitors, selective androgen receptor modulators, and hormonal therapies show promise in improving patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach, incorporating personalized exercise programs, targeted nutrition, and psychological support, is crucial for addressing the complex challenges of sarcopenia in COPD. Given its substantial burden, this research highlights critical strategies for optimizing care and improving functional outcomes in this high-risk population.",

Freezing is one of the most widely used and effective ways for preserving meat. However, freezing, frozen storage, and thawing can lead to changes that affect meat quality. The formation and subsequent melting of ice crystals can damage muscle cells and oxidize muscle components such as protein and fat, resulting in meat quality deterioration and loss of nutritional value. This review summarizes recent studies on the effects of these processes on the water status, quality, nutrition, and digestibility of meat, which explains how the formation, growth, and recrystallization of ice crystals cause water migration, cell damage, protein oxidation, lipid oxidation, water holding capacity reduction, and nutrition degradation. The aim is to provide theoretical guidance and research directions for controlling quality degradation, developing freezing and thawing technologies, and improving the quality and nutritional value of frozen meat.",

The dough water absorption capacity increased from 52.6 ± 0.21% to 57.6 ± 0.33%, 55.5 ± 0.42%, and 53.1 ± 0.12% when soybean, spinach, and pumpkin leaf proteins were incorporated into wheat flour at 5% w/w, respectively.

A higher content of free sulfhydryl groups observed in pumpkin (49.07 ± 1.03 µmol/g protein) and spinach leaf proteins (58.19 ± 0.49 µmol/g protein) was associated with a noticeable reduction in dough development time and stability compared to soy protein, where a considerably lower free sulfhydryl content (6.21 ± 0.21 µmol/g protein) was measured. The formation of a dough with higher mixing stability was attributed to hydrophobic interactions between soy proteins and similarly hydrophobic gluten. Significantly higher polyphenol content and biological activity were exhibited by dough enriched with pumpkin and spinach leaf proteins compared to dough made with wheat flour and fortified with soy protein. In addition, the essential amino acid profile of the enriched dough was notably improved through the addition of these plant-based proteins to wheat flour.",

    "combined_text": "The investigation of factors influencing the prognostic nutritional index in patients with esophageal cancer-a cross-sectional study.\n\nThe prognostic nutritional index (PNI) has garnered increasing attention for its role in predicting the nutritional status and prognosis of cancer patients. However, its influencing factors are still unclear, which limits its precise clinical application. This study aims to investigate the correlation between nutrition-related indicators and PNI and their impact on PNI, with the expectation of providing a more reliable basis for clinical nutritional assessment and intervention, filling the current gap in the research of influencing factors of PNI, and promoting the implementation of individualized nutritional therapy in the comprehensive management of esophageal cancer.\n\nThe clinical baseline data of 1,894 patients who underwent esophageal cancer surgery between January 2016 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to investigate the association between PNI and age, weight status, hepatic and renal function, glucose metabolism, inflammation, as well as other indicators.\n\nAmong the 1,894 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer, 1,599 (84.4%) were male and 295 (15.6%) were female. The age of onset was comparatively higher in females than in males. The univariate analysis of PNI revealed that the low PNI group had a higher average age compared to the high PNI group, and there was a significantly higher proportion of individuals aged ≥65 years in the low PNI group (55%) than in the high PNI group (46.6%) (P<0.05). The high PNI group exhibited significantly higher body weight and body mass index (BMI) compared to the low PNI group, along with a higher prevalence of overweight. Conversely, the low PNI group demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of wasting and neoadjuvant therapy (NT) treatment (P<0.05). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, by constructing the multivariate logistic regression equation, the results showed that: age [odds ratio (OR) =0.574, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.399-0.824, P=0.003] and NT (OR =0.186, 95% CI: 0.118-0.295, P<0.001) were identified as significant risk factors for high PNI group. Conversely, total protein (TP) (OR =17.194, 95% CI: 10.555-28.009, P<0.001), albumin/globulin ratio (A/G) (OR =5.128, 95% CI: 3.159-8.324, P<0.001), prealbumin (PA) (OR =3.195, 95% CI: 1.942-5.256, P<0.001), white blood cell (WBC) (OR =3.627, 95% CI: 1.729-7.608, P=0.001), platelet count (PLT) (OR =1.905, 95% CI: 1.047-3.465, P=0.035) and hemoglobin (Hb) (OR =2.499, 95% CI: 1.653-3.778, P=0.035) were protective factors in the high PNI group.\n\nPNI is an indicator that comprehensively reflects nutritional, immune and metabolic status. Patients with low PNI need to focus on the elderly, emaciated, and NT treatment groups, which also provides a basis for the timing of nutritional intervention. Meanwhile, increasing protein intake (improving TP and PA), correcting anemia (Hb), and maintaining PLT and WBC levels may help improve PNI and clinical prognosis.",

However, oat protein exhibits weak functional properties, particularly in emulsification. Casein-based ingredients are commonly employed to enhance emulsifying properties as a general practice in the food industry. pH-shifting processing is a straightforward method to partially unfold protein structures. This study modified a mixture of an oat protein isolate (OPI) and casein by combining a pH adjustment (adjusting the pH of two solutions to 12, mixing them at a 3:7 ratio, and maintaining the pH at 12 for 2 h) with an atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) treatment to improve the emulsifying properties. The results demonstrated that the ACP treatment significantly enhanced the solubility of the OPI/casein mixtures, with a maximum solubility of 82.63 ± 0.33%, while the ζ-potential values were approximately -40 mV, indicating that all the samples were fairly stable. The plasma-induced increase in surface hydrophobicity supported greater protein adsorption and redistribution at the oil/water interface. After 3 min of treatment, the interfacial pressure peaked at 8.32 mN/m. Emulsions stabilized with the modified OPI/casein mixtures also exhibited a significant droplet size reduction upon extending the ACP treatment to 3 min, decreasing from 5.364 ± 0.034 μm to 3.075 ± 0.016 μm. The resulting enhanced uniformity in droplet size distribution signified the formation of a robust interfacial film. Moreover, the ACP treatment effectively enhanced the emulsifying activity of the OPI/casein mixtures, reaching (179.65 ± 1.96 m",

An emulsion-templated approach was employed to structure SCGO with varying WP:SCGO ratios, while the incorporation of BCNW was evaluated as a potential stabilizing and reinforcing agent. All oleogels behaved as \"true\" gels (tan δ < 0.1). Rheological analysis revealed that higher WP content significantly increased gel strength, indicating enhanced structural integrity and deformation resistance. The addition of BCNW had a significant reinforcing effect in oleogels with a higher oil content (WP:SCGO 1:5), while its influence was less evident in formulations with lower oil content (WP:SCGO 1:2.5). Notably, depending on the WP:SCGO ratio, the storage modulus (G') data showed that the oleogels resembled both hard (WP:SCGO 1:2.5) and soft (WP:SCGO 1:5) solid fats, highlighting their potential as fat replacers in a wide range of food applications.

MAE improved polyphenol yield by 43.6% compared to conventional acidified methanol extraction. Structural and chemical analyses of the residual husk material using SEM, FTIR, and fiber analysis revealed that MAE alters husk properties, enhancing polyphenol accessibility. Thus, MAE appears an efficient and sustainable alternative to acid- and solvent-based extraction techniques. Extracts obtained via \"green\" methods retained strong antioxidant activity and showed significant modulation of inflammatory markers in human Caco-2 cells, highlighting the potential use of \"green\" buckwheat husk extracts for food and pharma applications.

In our study, the effects of a pretreatment of skim milk (SM) by Tgase on milk protein fractionation by microfiltration were tested. Tgase was found to induce amount-dependent modifications of all milk proteins in SM and a reduction in deposit resistance for laboratory dead-end filtrations of up to 20%. This improvement in process performance could partially be confirmed in pilot-scale cross-flow filtrations of Tgase-pretreated SM and micellar casein solutions (MCC). These comparative trials with untreated retentates under a variation of ΔpTM (0.5-2 bar) at 10 and 50° revealed distinct differences in deposit behavior and achieved the reduction in deposit resistance in a range of 0-20%. The possibility of pre-fouling with enzymatically pretreated MCC prior to SM filtration was also investigated. Under different pre-fouling conditions, practical modes of retentate change, and pre-foulant compositions, a switch to untreated SM consistently resulted in an immediate and major increase in deposit resistance by 50-150%. This was partially related to the change in the ionic environment and the protein fraction.

Extrusion analysis showed a reduction in maximum extrusion force from 325 N (0%) to 250 N (6%), and an increase in buffer time from 390 s to 500 s. Print fidelity at time 0 showed minimal deviation in the checkerboard geometry (area deviation: -12%), while the concentric cylinder showed the highest stability over 60 min (height deviation: 9%). These findings highlight the potential of using encapsulated bioactive compounds in 3D food printing to develop functional foods with tailored nutritional and mechanical properties.",

    "combined_text": "Identification of Anticancer Target Combinations to Treat Pancreatic Cancer and Its Associated Cachexia Using Constraint-Based Modeling.\n\nPancreatic cancer is frequently accompanied by cancer-associated cachexia, a debilitating metabolic syndrome marked by progressive skeletal muscle wasting and systemic metabolic dysfunction. This study presents a systems biology framework to simultaneously identify therapeutic targets for both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its associated cachexia (PDAC-CX), using cell-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs). The human metabolic network Recon3D was extended to include protein synthesis, degradation, and recycling pathways for key inflammatory and structural proteins. These enhancements enabled the reconstruction of cell-specific GSMMs for PDAC and PDAC-CX, and their respective healthy counterparts, based on transcriptomic datasets. Medium-independent metabolic biomarkers were identified through Parsimonious Metabolite Flow Variability Analysis and differential expression analysis across five nutritional conditions. A fuzzy multi-objective optimization framework was employed within the anticancer target discovery platform to evaluate cell viability and metabolic deviation as dual criteria for assessing therapeutic efficacy and potential side effects. While single-enzyme targets were found to be context-specific and medium-dependent, eight combinatorial targets demonstrated robust, medium-independent effects in both PDAC and PDAC-CX cells. These include the knockout of SLC29A2, SGMS1, CRLS1, and the RNF20-RNF40 complex, alongside upregulation of CERK and PIKFYVE. The proposed integrative strategy offers novel therapeutic avenues that address both tumor progression and cancer-associated cachexia, with improved specificity and reduced off-target effects, thereby contributing to translational oncology.",

However, extracting these signals solely from sparse, high-dimensional multi-omics data remains a major challenge due to heterogeneity and frequent missingness in patient profiles. To address this challenge, we present SeNMo, a self-normalizing deep neural network trained on five heterogeneous omics layers-gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA abundance, somatic mutations, and protein expression-along with the clinical variables, that learns a unified representation robust to missing modalities. Trained on more than 10,000 patient profiles across 32 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), SeNMo provides a baseline that can be readily fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks. On a held-out TCGA test set, the model achieved a concordance index of 0.758 for OS prediction, while external evaluation yielded 0.73 on the CPTAC lung squamous cell carcinoma cohort and 0.66 on an independent 108-patient Moffitt Cancer Center cohort.

The objective of this exploratory study was to assess the evolution of body composition and muscle strength after one year of treatment, and their relationship with metabolic biomarkers.\n\nProspective observational study in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and ultrasound (US); muscle strength was measured by handgrip dynamometry. Biomarkers analyzed included glucose, insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (and its fractions), triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), 6-interleukin (IL-6), vitamin D, myostatin, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21).\n\nSixty-one women (mean age 58 years) were included. After one year, fat mass and related parameters significantly increased, while skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength decreased. Sarcopenic obesity prevalence rose from 1.16% to 4.9%. No significant changes were found in biomarkers, but positive correlations were observed between fat parameters and insulin, HOMA-IR, and triglycerides, and negative correlations with HDL-cholesterol.\n\nBIA and US can detect unfavorable changes in body composition that are not reflected in conventional measurements. At one year post-diagnosis, women showed increased fat accumulation, muscle loss, and reduced strength, even without significant metabolic biomarker changes.

Whole-genome sequencing identified a novel in-frame duplication introducing an additional leucine at a highly conserved site within the transmembrane domain of the XK protein, resulting in impaired XK protein expression.

Utilizing a two-treatment experimental design, athletes were exposed to sensory evaluations either before or after receiving information. A combination of hedonic sensory analysis and economic evaluation assessed preferences through a non-hypothetical auction. Findings show that both sensory attributes-especially taste and aroma-and product information significantly influenced willingness to pay. The order of presentation played a crucial role: providing information first enhanced perceived value more strongly. While sensory evaluation moderately increased willingness to pay, product information had a stronger impact. A key contribution of this study is its novel evidence on how athletes balance sensory and informational cues in food evaluation-an aspect rarely explored. Contrary to assumptions that athletes ignore sensory quality due to their focus on nutrition, they did value sensory aspects, though they prioritized product information. These findings suggest that developing functional foods for athletes should integrate nutritional benefits and sensory appeal, as both elements contribute to acceptance and potential market success.",

The goal was to explore its potential to improve the nutritional value and sensory appeal of cookies relative to conventional and commercially available gluten-free alternatives. Nutritional analysis revealed that cookies with added sorghum flour showed increased levels of protein, ash, and polyphenolic compounds, while maintaining favorable macronutrient profiles. Notably, several bioactive compounds, such as gallic acid, caffeic acid, and apigenin, were detected exclusively in sorghum-containing samples, suggesting enhanced functional properties. Despite these compositional changes, textural measurements showed no significant differences in hardness or fracturability compared with the control. Sensory profiling using the Rate-All-That-Apply (RATA) method demonstrated that both samples (C20 and C40) achieved balanced results in terms of aroma as well as texture and were generally well accepted by the panel. The results indicate that moderate inclusion of sorghum flour (20% and 40%) can improve the sensory and nutritional profiles of gluten-free cookies without compromising product acceptability.

The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of the germination and pepsin/pancreatin hydrolysis reduction time on the techno-functional properties and nutraceutical potential of amaranth flours and hydrolysates. The germination process increased 12.5% soluble protein (SP), 23.7% total phenolics (TPC), 259% water solubility, and 26% oil absorption in germinated amaranth flours (GAFs) compared to ungerminated amaranth flours (UAFs).

The enzymatic hydrolysis released 1.5-fold SP and 14-fold TPC in both amaranth flours. The water solubility was higher in both hydrolysates than in their unhydrolyzed flour counterparts. The reduction in hydrolysis time did not significantly affect the nutraceutical potential of GAFH, enhancing its potential for further investigations.

However, in the United States, protein consumption worsens as individuals age, with 30% of men and 50% of women over 71 consuming inadequate dietary protein due to a variety of factors, including changes in gut function, loss of appetite, tooth loss, financial concerns, and social isolation. The aim of this review is to underscore the need for increased protein requirements in aging populations, highlight potential barriers, synthesize these protein requirements, and also recommend strategies to meet these increased protein needs. Achieving adequate protein status, especially when facing chronic or acute health concerns, is essential to promote muscle and bone strength (because aging is associated with significant decreases in postprandial muscle protein synthesis), to support immune health (due to immunosenescence), and to maintain a good quality of life. For older adults, the literature suggests that a dietary protein intake of at least 1.0-1.2 g/kg/day is required in healthy, aging populations, and intakes of 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day are necessary for those with chronic or acute conditions. These protein intake recommendations can increase to 2.0 g/kg/day in more severe cases of illness, malnutrition, and chronic conditions. The reviewed literature also suggests that evenly balanced protein distributions of 25-30 g of dietary protein (0.4 g/kg) per meal from animal and plant protein sources alike are sufficient to maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in older populations. Additionally, pre-sleep protein feeds of 40 g/night may be another strategy to improve daily MPS and amino acid utilization.",

However, its bioavailability and impact on lipid digestion and absorption remain poorly characterized. This study aimed to investigate silicon bioavailability after short-term DE supplementation and its effects on postprandial glycemia and triglyceridemia, the expression of lipid metabolism-related proteins, and the modulation of the intestinal mucosal barrier.\n\nFemale Wistar rats received daily oral supplementation of DE (equivalent to 2 or 4 mg silicon/kg body weight) for one week. Silicon digestibility, excretion, and hepatic accumulation were quantified. Postprandial glycemia and triglyceridemia were monitored. Lipid profile was analyzed by HPSEC in gastric and intestinal contents. Jejunal morphology and mucin-secreting cells were assessed histologically. Lipid metabolism markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in both intestinal and hepatic tissues.\n\nDE supplementation enhanced silicon absorption and increased hepatic levels. Fecal output and moisture content were also elevated, especially at the higher dose. DE significantly reduced postprandial triglyceridemia and consequently increased luminal triglyceride retention. These changes were associated with decreased jejunal levels of IFABP, ACAT2, and MTP, as well as reduced hepatic levels of MTP and LDLr, alongside increased levels of ABCG5/G8 and LXRα/β, indicating a partial blockage of lipid absorption and enhanced cholesterol efflux. The effects on the intestinal barrier were evidenced by villi shortening and an increase in mucin-producing cells.\n\nFood-grade DE is a bioavailable source of silicon with hypolipidemic potential, mainly by reducing intestinal lipid absorption. This is supported by lower postprandial triglycerides, increased luminal lipid retention, and decreased expression of lipid transport proteins. The study in healthy female rats underscores the importance of sex-specific responses and supports DE as a dietary strategy to improve lipid metabolism.",

We aimed to examine the effects of ShenQiGan extract (CAG) on intestinal barrier function and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms in stress-challenged weaned piglets. The experimental design involved 80 weaned piglets aged 28 days (with an average body weight of 7.78 ± 0.074 kg) that were randomly allocated into four groups: Control, LCAG (0.1% CAG), MCAG (0.5% CAG), and HCAG (1.0% CAG). After a 28-day trial period, the growth performance and incidence of diarrhea in piglets were evaluated. CAG increased the average daily gain of weaned piglets, reduced the feed-to-gain ratio, and decreased the incidence of diarrhea. It significantly lowered serum inflammatory cytokine levels while elevating immunoglobulin levels. The supplement notably enhanced concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid. Furthermore, CAG demonstrated intestinal morphology restoration and upregulation of tight junction proteins and MUC2 protein expression in jejunum. At the mRNA level, it significantly upregulated the expression of Occludin, Claudin1, and MUC2 genes. CAG improves growth performance and mitigates diarrhea in weaned piglets by enhancing intestinal barrier integrity, modulating systemic inflammatory responses, elevating immunoglobulin levels, and promoting short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in the cecum.",

These innovative sources aim to compete with conventional animal products by providing protein-rich, sustainable, nutritious, and flavorful options. Currently, five main categories of alternative proteins are being developed: plant-based proteins, cultured meat, single-cell proteins, edible insects, and seaweed. Nonetheless, several chemical and microbiological food safety hazards are associated with these alternatives Incorporating novel protein sources into food products may heighten the prevalence of existing food allergies. This could arise from extracting proteins from their natural matrices and utilizing them at significantly higher concentrations. Additionally, the introduction of new proteins may lead to the development of novel food allergies. Proteins that are currently seldom or never consumed may cause primary sensitisation or trigger cross-reactivity with known allergens. To date, alternative proteins have not been thoroughly studied for their allergenic potential, and there is no standardised method for assessing this risk. This review aims to explore non-traditional protein sources, discussing their nutritional and functional properties, as well as their potential allergenicity based on available research. We conducted a literature search in PubMed and Embase databases. We used specific keywords and MESH terms. A total of 157 studies were included in the review. The studies reviewed in our analysis reveal significant limitations, such as inconsistent methodologies, limited participant numbers, and a lack of long-term data, which hinder the ability to make clear conclusions regarding the safety of these new proteins for individuals with allergies. To address current challenge, future research should integrate food science, regulatory perspectives and advanced technologies.",

Multimodal prehabilitation-comprising nutritional support, physical exercise, and psychological interventions-has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance patients' resilience before CRC surgery. Clinical studies demonstrate that prehabilitation significantly reduces postoperative complications, shortens hospital stays, and improves functional recovery. Nutritional interventions focus on counteracting malnutrition and sarcopenia through tailored dietary counseling, protein supplementation, and immunonutrients like arginine and glutamine. Physical exercise enhances cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength while modulating immune and metabolic pathways critical for surgical recovery. Psychological support reduces anxiety and depression, promoting mental resilience that correlates with better postoperative outcomes. Despite clear clinical benefits, the molecular mechanisms underlying prehabilitation's effects-such as inflammation modulation, immune activation, and metabolic rewiring-remain poorly understood. This review addresses this knowledge gap by exploring potential biological pathways influenced by prehabilitation, aiming to guide more targeted, personalized approaches in CRC patient management. Advancing molecular insights may optimize prehabilitation protocols and improve survival and quality of life for CRC patients undergoing surgery.",

The intensity of the inflammatory response appears as the principal driver of the changes involved in outcome, and especially those affecting protein metabolism and muscle catabolism, and resistance to nutrition. The present exploratory study aims to clarify the role of the different cytokines in amino acid metabolism.\n\nIn this post-hoc analysis of the previously published observational study, including 51 critically ill patients and 49 healthy controls aiming at identifying patient changes in amino acid metabolism, we assessed the association between a panel of cytokines and blood levels of amino acids (AA) and their turnover. The subjects were matched for age, sex, and BMI. The study was conducted in postabsorptive state. Blood analysis included cytokines (determined by Luminex), C-reactive protein (CRP or hsCRP), and AA.\n\n8 mL solution containing 18 stable AA tracers administered as a pulse to calculate amino acid whole body production (WBP). WBP was calculated from fitted decay curves. We measured amino acid enrichments and concentrations by LC-MS/MS and derived statistics using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) t and stepwise regression. Data as means [95%CI].\n\nThe study included 51 critically ill patients (age 63 yrs [58, 68], APACHEII 21.6 [20, 24]) and 49 matched healthy controls (age 57 yrs [52, 61]). While anthropometric characteristics were similar between critically ill patients and healthy adults, phase angle was lower (3.9 [3.5, 4.2] vs 6.0 [5.6, 6.3], p < 0.001), most AA blood levels were lower, while most cytokine levels were significantly higher. IL-6 and CRP were strongly associated (p < 0.001). IL-6 was the cytokine with the strongest association with the AA blood levels and WBP alterations in patients. Three patterns of changes in the plasma cytokine concentrations were observed. Of the 37 cytokines measured, 12 were higher in ICU patients, 5 were lower, and the rest were similar.\n\nThe present study shows a comprehensive picture of inflammation and simultaneous alterations of AA metabolism. The levels of IL-6 and CRP may become a good indicator of the metabolic capacity to respond positively to nutrition therapy.\n\nData are from the baseline measurements of study NCT02770092 (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02770092) and NCT03628365 (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03628365).",

Using a 3-factor, 5-level central composite design (CCD) within a response surface methodology (RSM) framework, 960 male broilers were randomly divided into 16 treatments, each comprising 6 replicates with 10 birds per replicate. The treatments included a control group (Con) fed a 19 % CP diet, and 15 dietary treatments with graded levels of dLys (0.97-1.23 %), dMet (0.43-0.53 %), and dThr (0.64-0.84 %). Results indicated that dLys had the strongest linear effect on body weight gain (BWG; P < 0.001). The optimal SID ratios were determined as dMet/dLys = 0.41 (0.468 %/1.145 %) and dThr/dLys = 0.64 (0.730 %/1.145 %) for BWG, and dMet/dLys = 0.38 (0.454 %/1.180 %) and dThr/dLys = 0.64 (0.757 %/1.180 %) for FCR. These optimizations enabled a 10.5 % reduction in dietary CP level without compromising growth performance, along with a 32.3 % decrease in nitrogen (N) excretion compared with the Con group. Furthermore, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of amino acids (AA) improved significantly compared with the Con group (P < 0.001). In summary, the findings suggest that precise AA balancing, with a priority on lysine (Lys) sufficiency, could sustain broiler productivity in low-protein systems while reducing feed costs and environmental footprint.",

Six hundred Cobb500 day-old-chicks were allocated to five dietary treatments: Standard broiler diet, with no inclusion of AGPs (NegControl); Standard broiler diet, with inclusion of AGPs (PosControl); Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % probiotics (Prob); Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % stimbiotics (Stim) and Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % probiotics and 0.01 % stimbiotics) (ProbStim). Each dietary treatment was replicated 8 times, with a pen holding 15 birds as the experimental unit. The experimental trial was conducted over three feeding phases: starter phase (day 1- 14), grower phase (day 15- 28) and finisher phase (day 29- 42). The birds were subjected to heat stress in the grower phase and finisher phase for 3 h (11:00- 14:00 h). Diet had no effect on ADFI in the starter, grower and finisher phase. Similarly, diet had no effect on ADG and FCR in both grower and finisher phase. The cumulative weight gain was consistently low in broiler chickens fed the Stim diet throughout the feeding phases, while those fed Prob diet had higher weights in week 2 and to 6. Dietary treatments did not affect protein consumed, protein efficiency ratio, specific growth rate and growth efficiency across all the feeding phases. Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were significantly affected by diet (P < 0.05) with broiler chickens fed PosControl in non- stressed environment having the highest total cholesterol (3.90± 0.18) and triglyceride level (1.77± 0.12). With regards to behavioral response to heat stress induced discomfort, broilers fed PosControl (2.33±0.26) and Prob (2.33±0.26) exhibited increased pecking feed activity and increased tendencies of seeking cooler areas. Overall, the birds did not show signs of severe stress. In conclusion, Probiotics and Stimbiotics could be used in combination to replace of AGPs without negatively affecting productivity in broilers.",

In addition, B vitamins were determined for the first time in most of the varieties evaluated. Germination enhanced protein digestibility across all varieties, whereas IV-PDCAAS tended to decrease with increasing germination day. The impact of germination on starch content varied, with decreasing percentages found in some varieties and increased percentages found in others. Soluble fiber increased and insoluble fiber decreased with increasing germination days. Thiamine and niacin tended to increase with increasing germination day, while pyridoxine and folate decreased. The radical scavenging activity of the germinated peas increased with increasing germination days. Overall, germination tended to improve the nutritional composition of peas, with only a few exceptions. Furthermore, the interaction effects between variety and germination day support the importance of knowing both variety and length of germination when creating germinated pea products.",

In total, 27 multiparous cows (HF n = 17, SI n = 10) were enrolled in the study. All cows were kept on the same farm under identical management, feeding and housing conditions. BW of HF cows dropped while SI cows maintained their BW but produced less milk than HF cows during the first weeks of lactation. Differences were detected for the following indicators and related pathways, and were used to assess their biological impact. Branched-chain amino acids such as leucine and isoleucine at day +21 remained as high as at day -42 in HF cows; however, in SI cows, a clear drop in these amino acids was observed indicating less body protein mobilisation in this breed. Alpha amino-adipic acid and kynurenine as markers for oxidative stress balance were increased at day +21 in HF cows, only reflecting a metabolically more tensed condition in HF cows. As a conclusion, these findings confirm the impact of these metabolites on a higher risk to suffer from metabolic disorders.",

TFSE effectively reversed TNF-α-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, indicating anti-diabetic potential. TFSE also upregulated the phosphorylation of AKT (a key insulin signaling mediator) and the expression of adipogenic proteins (PPARγ, CEBPα) in TNF-α-exposed 3T3-L1, suggesting the mitigation of adipocyte dysfunction; however, the results did not reach statistical significance. The conventional extraction process was labor-intensive and time-consuming, and to enhance extraction efficiency and bioactivity, the process was subsequently optimized using environmentally friendly microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) in combination with the Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized extract (O-TFSE) was obtained over a significantly shorter extraction time and exhibited higher levels of total flavonoids and antioxidant activity in comparison to TFSE, while showing reduced levels of isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein) in relation to TFSE. Interestingly, O-TFSE retained similar efficacy in reversing TNF-α-induced insulin resistance and demonstrated significantly stronger α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities, indicating its enhanced potential for diabetes management.

Considering the role of chronic obesity-induced inflammation in MASLD pathogenesis, we investigated whether albumin administration could prevent disease progression to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). MASLD was induced in mice using a high-fat and high-cholesterol (PC) treatment for 8 weeks, followed by treatment with bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0.8 mg/kg) every three days for another 8 weeks. This regimen prevented time-dependent weight gain, regardless of diet, with 57% and 27% reductions in mice fed a standard chow (Std Chow) or PC diet, respectively. Further, supplementation reduced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation by 2.8-fold (",

    "combined_text": "Potential Health Benefits of Dietary Tree Nut and Peanut Enrichment in Kidney Transplant Recipients-An In-Depth Narrative Review and Considerations for Future Research.\n\nKidney transplant recipients face a substantial burden of premature mortality and morbidity, primarily due to persistent inflammation, cardiovascular risk, and nutritional deficiencies. Traditional nutritional interventions in this population have either focused on supplementing individual nutrients-often with limited efficacy-or required comprehensive dietary overhauls that compromise patient adherence. In this narrative review, we explore the rationale for dietary nut enrichment as a feasible, multi-nutrient strategy tailored to the needs of kidney transplant recipients. Nuts, including peanuts and tree nuts with no added salt, sugar, or oil, are rich in beneficial fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds. We summarize the multiple post-transplant challenges-including obesity, sarcopenia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, immunological dysfunction, and chronic inflammation-and discuss how nut consumption may mitigate these issues through mechanisms involving improved micro-nutrient intake (e.g., magnesium, potassium, selenium), lipid profile modulation, endothelial function, immune support, and gut microbiota health. Additionally, we highlight the scarcity of randomized controlled trials in high-risk populations such as kidney transplant recipients and make the case for studying this group as a model for investigating the clinical efficacy of nuts as a nutritional intervention. We also consider practical aspects for future clinical trials, including the choice of study population, intervention design, duration, nut type, dosage, and primary outcome measures such as systemic inflammation. Finally, potential risks such as nut allergies and oxalate or mycotoxin exposure are addressed. Altogether, this review proposes dietary nut enrichment as a promising, simple, and sustainable multi-nutrient approach to support cardiometabolic and immune health in kidney transplant recipients, warranting formal investigation in clinical trials.",

    "combined_text": "Assessing Milk Authenticity Using Protein and Peptide Biomarkers: A Decade of Progress in Species Differentiation and Fraud Detection.\n\nMilk is a nutritionally rich food and a frequent target of economically motivated adulteration, particularly through substitution with lower-cost milk types. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the authentication of milk using advanced proteomic and chemometric approaches, with a focus on the discovery and application of protein and peptide biomarkers for species differentiation and fraud detection. Recent innovations in both top-down and bottom-up proteomics have markedly improved the sensitivity and specificity of detecting key molecular targets, including caseins and whey proteins. Peptide-based methods are especially valuable in processed dairy products due to their thermal stability and resilience to harsh treatment, although their species specificity may be limited when sequences are conserved across related species. Robust chemometric approaches are increasingly integrated with proteomic pipelines to handle high-dimensional datasets and enhance classification performance. Multivariate techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), are frequently employed to extract discriminatory features and model adulteration scenarios. Despite these advances, key challenges persist, including the lack of standardized protocols, variability in sample preparation, and the need for broader validation across breeds, geographies, and production systems. Future progress will depend on the convergence of high-resolution proteomics with multi-omics integration, structured data fusion, and machine learning frameworks, enabling scalable, specific, and robust solutions for milk authentication in increasingly complex food systems.",

This study evaluated tacos made with five commercial nixtamalized maize flours and four common fillings (chicharron, beef skirt, potato, and refried beans), processed using three different methods: Plain, Full-Fat, and Patted-Dry. We assessed their chemical composition, starch digestibility, and thermal properties, and measured satiety-related hormone responses in mice. Fillings had a stronger influence on protein, fat, and moisture content than tortilla type. Full-fat tacos exhibited increased amylose-lipid complex formation and a lower gelatinization enthalpy, whereas plain tacos retained more retrograded starch and a crystalline structure. In vitro digestion revealed that Plain tacos, especially those with plant-based fillings, had the highest resistant starch content and the lowest predicted glycemic index. Hierarchical clustering showed that resistant starch, moisture, and gelatinization onset temperature were closely linked in the Plain samples, whereas lipid-driven variables dominated in the Full-Fat tacos. In mice, tacos with a higher resistant starch content led to greater GLP-1 levels, lower ghrelin levels, and reduced insulin responses, suggesting improved satiety and glycemic control. Patted-Dry tacos showed intermediate hormonal effects, supporting their potential as a balanced, health-conscious alternative.

Both oral and gut microbiota undergo changes with aging, characterized by a decline in microbial diversity and a shift toward potentially harmful species. The aim of this review is, therefore, to provide an overview of oral-gut communications in mediating frailty and sarcopenia. PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles. We limited our search to manuscripts published in the English language. Interactions between oral and gut microbiota occur mainly through three pathways namely the enteral, the bloodstream and the fecal-oral routes. Alterations in the oral-gut microbiota axis contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation (i.e., \"inflamm-ageing\") and mitochondrial dysfunction, key mechanisms underlying frailty and sarcopenia. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids and modified bile acids, appear to play an emerging role in influencing microbial homeostasis and muscle metabolism. Furthermore, poor oral health associated with microbial dysbiosis may contribute to altered eating patterns that negatively impact gut microbiota eubiosis, further exacerbating muscle decline and the degree of frailty. Strategies aimed at modulating the microbiota, such as healthy dietary patterns with reduced consumption of ultra-processed foods, refined carbohydrates and alcohol, ensuring an adequate protein intake combined with physical exercise, as well as supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, are increasingly recognized as promising interventions to improve both oral and gut microbiota health, with beneficial effects on frailty and sarcopenia. A better understanding of the oral-gut microbiota axis offers promising insights into nutritional interventions and therapeutic strategies for the age-related muscle decline, frailty and systemic health maintenance.",

We uncovered casein kinase 1 delta (CK1δ) as a central mediator of this dysfunction, acting via phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SNAPIN. Vpr-induced CK1δ activation leads to hyperphosphorylation of SNAPIN, disrupting lysosomal positioning and motility. These defects are rescued by selective CK1δ inhibition, which restores lysosomal acidification, positioning, and mitophagy. Our findings define a novel Vpr-CK1δ-SNAPIN axis contributing to HAND and highlight lysosomal transport as a targetable mechanism in neurodegeneration.",

Limited data exist on whether these differences are also present for established populations of Okinawans and mainland Japanese in the United States. Dimensionality reduction techniques for genetic data combined with Okinawan surnames were used to identify Multiethnic Cohort Japanese American participants (N=24,484) of Okinawan or mainland descent. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare cancer incidence between Okinawan and mainland Japanese participants. Geometric means were examined on a subset of MEC participants for circulating blood biomarker levels (N=2,980) and body composition (N=399). The Okinawan cluster included 3,649 individuals and the mainland cluster included 19,611 individuals. Okinawan individuals were more likely to have a higher average body mass index and shorter stature, better diet quality score, higher total energy intake, more alcohol consumption among drinkers, and a history of never smoking compared to mainland Japanese (all p-values<0.0001). In multivariable adjusted models, Okinawan women were more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer (HR=1.36, 95% CI=1.07-1.73) and Okinawan men were less likely to be diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer (HR=0.67, 95% CI=0.51-0.87) compared to their mainland Japanese counterparts. In subsets of MEC participants, adiponectin levels were lower, and C-reactive protein levels, visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) and the VAT-to- subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio were higher, in Okinawans compared to mainland Japanese (all p-values<0.05). Results in this US-based sample are consistent with recent trends of higher breast and lower prostate cancer incidence rates in Okinawans reported from Japan.\n\nCancer rate differences have been documented in Japan between Okinawa and mainland Japan; however, limited data exist on whether these differences are present in Japanese Americans of Okinawan or mainland descent. We report significant differences in breast cancer, prostate cancers, body composition, and obesity-related biomarkers for these two groups. Our findings suggest that these cancer risk disparities may not be solely due to lifestyle, but could be explained by body composition, genetics, or unmeasured factors.",

In this study, we investigated the factors influencing withdrawal from MV after tracheostomy and cannulation in patients undergoing long-term tracheal intubation. We also examined tracheostomy status (whether the tracheostomy tube was removed and whether the patient was weaned from MV) and discharge outcomes.\n\nA total of 199 patients who underwent tracheostomy following long-term tracheal intubation were analyzed. Patients were classified into 3 groups based on tracheostomy status: group A (tracheostomy tube removed; n = 35); group B (tracheostomy tube not removed despite weaning from MV; n = 76); and group C (weaning from MV not achieved; n = 88).\n\nThe duration of intensive care unit stay did not differ significantly among the groups. However, hospital stay was significantly shorter in group C than in groups A and B. Additionally, the rate of discharge to home was significantly higher in group A. Factors associated with difficulty in weaning from MV included a blood lymphocyte count <500, the presence of chest and abdominal disease, and a body mass index ≥30. Factors contributing to with difficulty in decannulation after weaning from MV included head and neck disease, age ≥75 years, C-Reactive Protein ≥5, and a blood lymphocyte count <500.\n\nWeaning from MV and decannulation are key factors influencing discharge to home in patients undergoing tracheostomy after long-term intubation. These factors are primarily affected by the patient's underlying disease and general condition. We believe that addressing these factors through nutritional management, rehabilitation, and other supportive measures can improve the quality of life and increase the likelihood of discharge to home.",

Current monitoring techniques often rely on protein nitrogen content, which can be misrepresented by these additives. We report a reflective holographic sensor that can directly detect diluted milk by monitoring the shrinkage of the holographic grating, which induces a rapid and reversible blue shift of 34 nm across milk dilutions ranging from 10 to 100 vol%. The holographic milk sensor demonstrates high selectivity, remaining unaffected by variations in fat content, ionic strength, or pH. Testing with various casein suspensions reveals that the shrinkage effect is specifically triggered by calcium caseinate micelles, in marked contrast to free casein slurries in water. Moreover, adding melamine to artificially compensate for the nitrogen loss in diluted milk results in swelling rather than contraction. This holographic sensor offers a reliable and effective tool for quality control in the dairy industry.",

Exposure to high concentrations of ABA during seed germination resulted in the identification of 23 putative mutant lines, which were re-evaluated to select those with the strongest ABA-insensitive phenotype. Whole-genome resequencing of ABA-sensitive and -insensitive plants of the selected mutant line 2087 revealed a G > A transition in a gene encoding the phosphatase 2C protein clade H CpPP2C-H1A as responsible for the ABA-insensitive phenotype. The so-called pp2c-h1a mutation resulted in the substitution of E345K in a conserved amino acid within a conserved motif of plant PP2Cs. The mutation did not alter the germination rate in water, but favored germination in the presence of ABA. The pp2c-h1a mutation increased water loss under various stress conditions, while increasing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and preventing stomatal closure in response to external ABA treatments. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR revealed that the transcripts of CpPP2C-H1A and its paralog CpPP2C-H1B accumulated similarly in all tissues analyzed. The transcription of both genes was not altered by the pp2c-h1a mutation. The transcription of CpPP2C-H1A did not change in response to treatments with ABA, cold, PEG, and NaCl in seedling leaves, and that of CpPP2C-H1B changed only in response to cold. However, the expression of both genes was up-regulated in seeds after imbibition and germination and was significantly induced by NaCl treatment in germinated seeds. Taken together, these data indicate that CpPP2C-H1A acts as a negative regulator of ABA signaling in germination inhibition and stomatal closure under adverse conditions.",

Miyoshi myopathy is thought to occur due to genetic mutations in the DYSF gene, which codes for the dysferlin protein, which is critical for muscle cell membrane integrity and muscle fiber adhesiveness. The first symptoms begin in early adulthood and include weakness and atrophy in the calves, gait abnormalities, pain and discomfort in affected muscles, and difficulty jumping or walking on tiptoes. Patients generally are diagnosed by a combination of physical exam findings, genetic testing, muscle biopsy, and elevated creatinine kinase (CK) levels. Management of the disease progression includes physical therapy to strengthen the muscles, nutritional support, occupational therapy, and assisted device education. While not life-threatening, Miyoshi myopathy outlook is generally considered moderate to poor due to significant muscle weakness and eventual loss of mobility usually in 10-20 years after onset. We present a unique case of a 66-year-old male patient complaining of pain in his bilateral calves after having had a series of back surgeries 10 years prior. A diagnosis of Miyoshi myopathy, a rare occurrence in this age group, was made based on CK levels.

Patients with severe gastrointestinal function injury admitted to the ICU from February 2021 to January 2024 were enrolled [age > 18 years old, acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) grade 2 to 3, stable hemodynamics]. Patients with different AGI grades were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the TEAS group and the control group using simple randomization. Both groups received conventional treatment and enteral nutrition (EN). In addition, the TEAS group underwent TEAS at the Neiguan and Zusanli points for 30 minutes per session, twice daily for 7 days. Baseline data, including age, gender, underlying diseases, and primary diagnoses, were recorded. Three intestinal biomarkers, such as I-FABP, D-lactic acid, and citrulline were measured before and after 7 days of treatment. EN tolerance indicators and 28 days survival status were documented. The differences in various indicators were compared between the two groups, subgroup analyses were conducted based on AGI grading, and interaction between AGI grade and TEAS were analyzed. The 28-day Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for both groups.\n\nFinally, 133 patients were included, with 68 in the TEAS group and 65 in the control group. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. A comparison of the dynamic changes in intestinal biomarkers revealed that the I-FABP level in both groups decreased after treatment compared to pre-treatment, with a more pronounced reduction in the TEAS group. The least square mean difference (LS Mean difference) for the corrected I-FABP level between the two groups during the observation period was -0.23 μg/L [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was -0.45 to -0.01], which was statistically significant (P = 0.041). Additionally, a significant interaction with AGI was observed (P = 0.004). Post-treatment, D-lactic acid level decreased in both groups compared to pre-treatment, with a more significant reduction in the TEAS group. The LS Mean difference for the corrected D-lactic acid level was -0.08 mmol/L (95%CI was -0.11 to -0.05), which was statistically significant (P < 0.001), and the interaction with AGI was also significant (P = 0.005). There was no significant change in citrulline levels between the two groups before and after treatment. The LS Mean difference for the corrected citrulline level was -0.17 μmol/L (95%CI was -1.87 to 1.53), which was not statistically significant (P = 0.845), and no significant interaction with AGI was observed (P = 0.913). Comparison of EN tolerance parameters between the two groups revealed that the TEAS group had a longer total EN time (hours: 72±31 vs. 60±28) and higher total EN calories (kJ: 11 469.23±7 237.34 vs. 6 638.76±5 098.37), as well as a higher 70% target caloric attainment rate (52.9% vs. 32.3%) compared to the control group (all P < 0.05). The incidence of abdominal distension after EN was lower in the TEAS group than that in the control group (23.5% vs. 43.1%, P < 0.05), while the incidence of diarrhea after EN was higher in the TEAS group (22.1% vs. 7.7%, P < 0.05). There were no significantly differences in AGI grade reduction rate, post-EN vomiting/gastric retention rate, incidence of feeding interruption, and 28-day survival rate between the two groups. Furthermore, there were no significantly interaction between these observation measures and AGI. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that there was no significantly difference in 28-day cumulative survival rate between the TEAS group and the control group [Log-Rank test: P = 0.501, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.81, 95%CI was 0.43-1.51), and there was no significantly interaction with AGI (P = 0.702).\n\nThe advantage of TEAS in the treatment of ICU patients with severe gastrointestinal function injury lies in its ability to reverse intestinal cell necrosis and promote the reconstruction of intestinal barrier function. Additionally, gastrointestinal tolerance is significantly improved, and both the duration and total calories of EN are increased. However, the limitation of TEAS therapy is that it does not promote the recovery of intestinal cell absorption and synthesis function in the target patients. Moreover, it may lead to nutrient solution overload due to improved gastrointestinal tolerance. Furthermore, TEAS does not appear to improve 28-day cumulative survival rate in the target patients.",

    "combined_text": "A Comprehensive Review on Recent Advances in Plant Flour-Based Edible Tableware.\n\nNowadays, plastic has become an integral part of our daily used products. Packaging is the sector where a significant portion of plastics are being used, and it has increased many folds after the recent pandemic. The plastic-based cutlery, cups, bowls, and plates have been commonly used in ready-to-eat packaged food, and they include mostly single-use plastic; thus, there is an urgent need for substitution with eco-friendly alternatives. The edible cups, bowls, and cutlery could be a promising alternative to the plastic counterparts. This review debated the current scenario in edible cutlery fabrication and characterization. The plant-based, eco-friendly edible flour materials are commonly used for fabricating edible cutlery such as bowls, cups, and spoons. The fortification and enrichment of additives into the edible cutlery and tableware were promising to improve the physical and functional performance. To develop edible cutlery, various flours such as millet, wheat, and rice have already been explored, and the results are promising for attaining sustainable development. The edible spoons prepared by using various flours such as finger millet and wheat flour with ashwagandha powder showed high proximate composition, including protein 5.96% and carbohydrates 85.73%. Similarly, the edible cutlery prepared using rice flour, wheat flour, and banana blossom powder resulted in a high water absorption capacity of 31.59% and showed high biodegradable capacity and decayed in 5 days. The use of this edible tableware not only reduces plastic waste issues but also makes our food healthier and nutrition-rich. Hence, this review aims to provide an overview of edible cutlery's needs and current status.",

From this, sarcopenia has an estimated prevalence of 10%-16% of older people worldwide. Losing strength and muscle mass in the 65-70 age group represents a significant public health problem. In this review, we emphasize the essential importance of strength training in managing sarcopenia, highlighting the role of microRNAs, small nucleotides that were the subject of last year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. These microRNAs regulate protein synthesis and are present in all biological fluids. Some of them are expressed differently by subjects affected by sarcopenia (as happens in various forms of cancer or other diseases). Therefore, monitoring a specific signature of microRNAs can better clarify the etiopathology of sarcopenia, providing an early biomarker for sarcopenia (currently, there are some hypotheses, but none is well recognized), and even serve as the basis for the development of drugs.",

Independent predictors linked to recurrence and RFS were identified through comprehensive univariate and multivariate analyses, and the identified factors were subsequently integrated into nomogram models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and the concordance index (C-index) were employed to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomograms.\n\nOur investigation identified several key risk factors for recurrence, including age, tumor number, tumor differentiation, preoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI), preoperative systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and postoperative protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) level. For RFS, significant predictors included tumor number, tumor differentiation, preoperative SII, postoperative PIVKA-II, and postoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The nomograms exhibited strong predictive performance, achieving a C-index of 0.837 (95% CI: 0.775-0.896) for recurrence prediction and 0.837 (95% CI: 0.788-0.886) for RFS. Our nomogram for recurrence prediction outperformed traditional staging systems like China Liver Cancer (CNLC) staging and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC). Calibration curves and discriminative ability assessments confirmed the nomograms' reliability in predicting actual outcomes and stratifying patients into distinct prognostic subgroups with significant RFS differences across risk categories.\n\nThe nomogram models established in this research provide an exceptionally accurate and individualized method for predicting recurrence and RFS in initially uHCC patients undergoing LPI-based conversion hepatectomy, potentially aiding clinicians in devising tailored treatment plans and enhancing patient outcomes.",

Three approaches were tested to establish a 3D model culture system: matrix-free ovarian spheroids (MFOS), a Matrigel-based three-layer gradient system (3LGS), and Biosilk scaffolds (Silk-Ovarioid). In parallel, paired controls from each patient and ovarian area were cultured in a standard 2D system for the same duration.\n\nThe 3D culture systems were monitored every second day to detect signs of aggregation and growth. Freshly fixed tissue, as well as 2D- and 3D-cultured samples were further processed for transcriptomic profiling after 42 days of culture using RNA sequencing. The culture of the 3D system was further characterized, regarding its protein profile and steroid and cytokine production, through proteomics and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and the Luminex platform, respectively.

Research indicates that oxidative stress induced by HFD mediates hepatic insulin resistance (HIR) through mechanisms such as promoting inflammation and lipid accumulation. Given that 4'-methoxyresveratrol (4-MR) exhibits remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, it is of great research significance to explore whether it can effectively counteract HFD-induced HIR by enhancing antioxidant stress.\n\nThis study aimed to explore the effects of 4MR on liver oxidative damage and insulin sensitivity.\n\nMice were fed a HFD for 8 weeks, followed by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test to assess insulin resistance. The in-vivo experiments were divided into three groups, including the control group, the HFD group, and the HFD + 4MR group. After 6 weeks of 4MR treatment, blood and liver samples were analyzed for biochemical markers, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant capacity, and liver protein levels. Insulin-resistant HepG2 cells were treated with 4MR and evaluated for proliferation and toxicity.\n\n4MR reduced fasting blood glucose and lipid levels, improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased liver malondialdehyde levels, while increasing catalase and antioxidant enzyme activities.

However, elucidating the metabolic capabilities and genetic determinants of biodegrading strains is crucial for optimizing bioremediation strategies. In this study, we comprehensively characterize the aromatic catabolic potential of two indigenous bacterial isolates, A. xylosoxidans C2 (A. x. C2) and A. xylosoxidans KW38 (A. x. KW38), obtained from hydrocarbon-impacted environments in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Experimental validation through aromatic hydrocarbons supplemented growth studies confirmed the capability of the isolated bacteria to mineralize bisphenol A, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 1-naphthalenemethanol, and the high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), pyrene, in the presence of glucose. Their degradation efficiencies were comparable to or greater than those of Pseudomonas paraeruginosa, a well-characterized model organism for aromatic compound degradation. Integrated bioinformatic analyses uncovered fundamental aromatic catabolic pathways conserved across Achromobacter species, along with strain-specific genes that potentially confer specialized degradative capacities, highlighting the genomic basis of the observed metabolic versatility. Further, protein modeling based on the curated sequences revealed unique features of individual catabolic enzymes and their interaction networks. Notably, a dehydrogenase enzyme involved in aromatic ring cleavage was identified exclusively in these UAE isolates. These findings establish A. x. C2 and A. x. KW38 as promising bioremediators of diverse aromatic pollutants. Overall, the study exemplifies a powerful and comprehensive methodological framework that bridges bioinformatic analysis and experimental research to further optimize the effectiveness of experimental design. We achieved a substantial reduction in the number of unknown genetic and metabolic determinants of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation in the strains, reducing uncertainty by 99.3%, thereby enhancing the overall process and outcomes for systematic biodiscovery of pollutant-degrading environmental microbes to address ecological challenges.",

Methotrexate promotes AMPK activation by inhibiting 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (ZMP) formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate (IMP) cyclohydrolase (ATIC), which converts ZMP, an endogenous purine precursor and an active form of the pharmacological AMPK activator AICAR, to IMP during de novo purine synthesis. In addition to methotrexate, inhibition of purine synthesis underpins the therapeutic effects of a number of commonly used immunosuppressive, anticancer, and antimicrobial drugs, raising the question of whether activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle could be a recurrent feature of these drugs. Using L6 myotubes, we found that AICAR-induced AMPK activation and glucose uptake were enhanced by inhibitors of the conversion of IMP to GMP (mycophenolate mofetil) or of IMP to AMP (alanosine) as well as by indirect inhibitors of human (trimetrexate) and bacterial ATIC (sulfamethoxazole). 6-Mercaptopurine, which inhibits the conversion of IMP to GMP and AMP, activated AMPK, increased glucose uptake, and suppressed insulin signaling, but did not enhance the effect of AICAR. As determined by measuring oxygen consumption rate, none of these agents suppressed mitochondrial function.

While moderate plant protein intake might be beneficial in early CKD, our findings in advanced stages were largely non-significant and require confirmation in larger studies before clinical recommendations can be made. These findings support a more nuanced approach to dietary protein source management in CKD, though further prospective studies are needed to confirm these associations.",

This can lead to reduced seroconversion rates and compromised herd immunity in children. Nutritional interventions have been proposed to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, yet evidence remains scattered and context specific.\n\nThis systematic review assesses the impact of nutritional interventions-especially vitamin A, zinc supplementation, and protein-energy rehabilitation-on serological responses to routine childhood vaccines among malnourished children in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Health Library for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews reporting on nutritional supplementation and vaccine seroconversion outcomes in malnourished children.\n\nFrom 3,245 records, 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A supplementation improved measles vaccine seroconversion by 35%, especially among deficient children. Zinc enhanced responses to oral vaccines by 20%. Protein-energy rehabilitation significantly increased seroconversion rates for BCG and measles vaccines, particularly in children recovering from severe acute malnutrition.\n\nNutritional interventions improve vaccine immunogenicity among malnourished children. Integrated strategies combining immunization and nutrition services should be prioritized to address immunity gaps in vulnerable populations.",

This study aimed to examine the relationship between serum lipid levels and COPD risk.\n\nThe methods of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were employed to investigate the relationships between lipids and COPD across multiple populations. Data from 2013 to 2023 were selected for the NHANES study on US population, and weighted multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was employed as the primary statistical method. And data utilized for the MR analysis were derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted on European and East Asian populations, with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method serving as the principal statistical approach.\n\nThe NHANES analyses indicated that higher levels of total cholesterol (TC) (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77-0.93), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.78-0.94) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74-0.97) were associated with a reduced risk of COPD in the US population. In the MR analyses, TC (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.84-0.95), non-HDL-C (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85-0.96), and LDL-C (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82-0.94) were causally linked to a decreased risk of COPD in the European population. Similar associations were observed in the East Asian population.\n\nOur study identified associations between TC, non-HDL-C, and LDL-C with a reduced risk of COPD. This underscores the importance of monitoring lipid metabolism in patients with COPD and provides supporting evidence for the use of lipid-based therapies in its treatment.",

Additionally, in response to anecdotal reports on the internet that have not been corroborated by clinical trials, this research examines the relationship between creatine consumption and gastrointestinal outcomes, aiming to address the existing knowledge gap in this area.\n\nThis study utilized data from the 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariable logistic regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the association between dietary creatine intake and the risk of diarrhea and constipation. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was employed to assess potential nonlinear relationships.\n\nIn the fully adjusted model, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed 2-day average dietary creatine intake-equivalent to a tenfold increase in absolute intake-was associated with a 19% lower risk of chronic constipation (adjusted OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65-0.96,\n\nHigher dietary creatine intake may offer protective benefits against chronic constipation, particularly in specific subgroups, while showing no significant association with chronic diarrhea.

    "combined_text": "Insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of lysyl oxidase like 1 in cancers.\n\nCancer is one of the primary causes of human mortality and a significant barrier to increasing human life expectancy. The effective screening, early diagnosis, and treatment of cancer have long been clinical challenges, and thus new biomarkers or molecular targets must be identified to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. Lysyl oxidase like 1 (LOXL1), a secreted copper-dependent amine oxidase, is commonly expressed in a variety of cell types. LOXL1 can maintain the steady state of elastin, engage in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. LOXL1 has diverse biological functions, and its dysregulation is the basis of many clinical diseases. The abnormal expression or activation of LOXL1 can disrupt the cellular microenvironment, contributing to the development of various diseases, such as atherosclerosis, tissue damage, fibrosis, and cancer. Recent research has revealed that LOXL1 is often overexpressed in a majority of cancers, where it plays a role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis. However, some studies have also suggested that LOXL1 may have a tumor-suppressive function. Research has indicated that the LOXL1 protein is reduced in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and bladder cancer (BLCA), where it acts to suppress tumor growth. Conversely, it is upregulated in human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pleural mesothelioma (PM), brain glioma, prostate cancer (PRAD), gastric cancer (GC), breast cancer (BC), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and osteosarcoma (OS). The expression of LOXL1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a topic of debate, as it may either be upregulated or downregulated. These findings imply that LOXL1 may have a dual role in cancer, either inhibiting or facilitating carcinogenesis. This article provides a comprehensive review of the structure and function of LOXL1, along with its associations with cancer. Additionally, it explores the role of LOXL1 in tumor microenvironment remodeling, tumorigenesis, metastasis, and the molecular mechanisms that underpin these processes.",

The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in serum, as well as the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver tissue were measured. Changes in the gut microbiota of mice was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing technology. The expression levels of PPARγ, Plin2, Pck1, Acsl4, and Fads1 proteins, as well as those of zonula occludins 1 (ZO-1) and Occludin proteins in the colon tissue were detected by Western Blot.\n\nThe results showed that Sch B could alleviate the structure disorder, ballooning degeneration, inflammatory cell infiltration, liver lipid droplets, and fibrosis in liver tissue, lower the levels of AST, ALT, TG, TC, LDL-C, and LPS, increase the level of HDL-C and lower the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in serum, increase the level of IL-10, and lower the level of MDA and increase the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in liver tissue in MAFLD mice. Sch B could increase the expression levels of PPARγ, Pck1, and Fads1 proteins, but decrease Plin2 and Acsl4 proteins in liver tissue. Sch B could improve the diversity and abundance of the gut microbiota, restore the normal composition of the gut microbiota at the phylum and genus levels, alleviate the disruption of the gut barrier caused by HFD, and enhance the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin proteins in colon tissue in MAFLD mice.\n\nThis study showed Sch B can improve HFD-induced MAFLD, and the mechanism may be through regulating the PPARγ, Plin2, PCk1, Acsl4 and Fads1 signaling pathway, restoring the diversity of gut microbiota, and improving the gut barrier to delay the progression of MAFLD.",
