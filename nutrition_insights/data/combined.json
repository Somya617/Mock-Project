How beneficial is this in improving SPI protein quality for muscle synthesis. The product adds 3g of leucine and this supposedly improve the amino acid profile of SPI. The logic seems to add up but I am curious if this makes a good source compare to whey protein WPC/WPI.\n\n2. Whether in food industry it is acceptable to not call this as \"amino spiking\" that is synonymous with scamming protein amount per serving due to higher nitrogen content. \n\nIf the product is transparent of its purpose but uses protein content per serving without deducting the added leucine; is it considered amino spiking? Is all \"amino spiking\" bad? Should the company revise their labels, marketing and change the protein content advertised? \n\nI am more inclined to say it's okay but perhaps people from the nutrition field can describe it better or have specific opinions.\n\nThis is not a post seeking professional medical advice.",

However questions arise on:\n\n1. How beneficial is this in improving SPI protein quality for muscle synthesis. The product adds 3g of leucine and this supposedly improve the amino acid profile of SPI. The logic seems to add up but I am curious if this makes a good source compare to whey protein WPC/WPI.\n\n2. Whether in food industry it is acceptable to not call this as \"amino spiking\" that is synonymous with scamming protein amount per serving due to higher nitrogen content. \n\nIf the product is transparent of its purpose but uses protein content per serving without deducting the added leucine; is it considered amino spiking? Is all \"amino spiking\" bad? Should the company revise their labels, marketing and change the protein content advertised? \n\nI am more inclined to say it's okay but perhaps people from the nutrition field can describe it better or have specific opinions.\n\nThis is not a post seeking professional medical advice.\n\nComments:\nI don't really see a problem with \"amino spiking\". Though I would also question if you needed to add the leucine at all. Chances are the person would not be deficient in leucine anyway, especially if they are intaking protein in excess. \n\nWhen I took a look at a soy protein isolate (25g) on Chronometer the leucine amount was fine.",

    "combined_text": "Title: Premier Protein lost a customer\n\nPost: I have been buying Premier Protein ready-to-drink shakes for years now. Recently, they switched the packaging on the chocolate flavor (brown -> purple). I picked up a case last week and it tastes completely different. It doesn’t taste like chocolate at all, frankly. It tastes like plain milk, even after shaking it vigorously. \n\nI filed a product complaint with Premier Protein today and I’m waiting to hear back. I’m not optimistic that my case was a one-off manufacturing error, but I’m interested to hear what they say. In the end, if they say nothing is wrong with it, then I’ll be switching to a different brand. \n\nHas anyone else experienced a total change to the chocolate flavor after the packaging switched?\n\nComments:\nOptimum Nutrition whey has gotten muuuuuuch tastier but it's powder and you gotta mix it with milk for it to taste best. I just use a coffee frother instead of a shaker so I don't get the dreaded next-day shaker smell on accident. If you mix it with half the milk and then add the rest while it's mixing, it's soooooo creamy. A tablespoon of heavy whipping cream on bulking cycles is divine.\n\nI like Pure Protein better. I thought Premier was too bitter. Pure Protein tastes more chocolatey and has less calories.\n\nI’m sure they don’t care. They’re scamming plenty of other people who haven’t heard of protein powder and enjoy wasting money",

But it's not a big enough difference to stress over. \n\nThe only one I see commonly recommended to not really count toward your protein totals is pure collagen protein because it's very limited in EAAs.\n\nI think some of the answers here are sort of touching on the idea of amino acids. \n\nOP, if you are curious to look at amino acids more, there is a free tool online where you can estimate the amount of the essential amino acids in a combination of foods, even an entire day's menu, if you like. \n\nThis is a link with a couple of the foods you mentioned already logged in.\n\nThe totals that it adds up on the barchart are for the rdi (minimum recommended daily intake)  for one day, so if you were to log every food you ate in a day, all those totals should be at 100% or more\n\n[https://tools.myfooddata.com/protein-calculator/168878-170016/wt1-wt1/1-1/1](https://tools.myfooddata.com/protein-calculator/168878-170016/wt1-wt1/1-1/1)\n\nBut yes, for total protein,  you can simply add up the grams!\n\nYep, you just add them. But pairing peas and rice also makes a complete protein, bonus points.",

Has taken me a long time to dial this in, but it’s intuitive for me now.\n\n1. Wake up. Have an energy drink or a coffee and a b complex. \n2. Exercise. \n3. First meal. High on fat, low in carbs, a little bit of protein. Look looking to get 5-6 hours before the hunger sets in. Currently ricotta with grated tumeric/olive oil/black pepper, and some sort of toast with butter. The fat is great fuel. The fresh tumeric is good for you and there is a little protien in the ricotta.  \n4. Second meal. Largest meal. Meat and vegetables. Think steak and roasted brocolli. Something fermented. \n5. Third meal. More of a snack. Cheese and crackers and some nuts and pickles. Or granola and berries and Greek yogurt. Something fermented if possible. Maybe ice cream. Maybe cookies and milk. Carb level depends on amount of exercise planned the next morning.\n\nWhat I’ve done, or at least figured out, is a metabolically flexible path where I exercise fasted and fuel from fats (and my own fats) until later in the day. Next meal provides real nourishment and satiety. The snack optionally adds back in any carbs which can be strategically increased depending on what I’m doing in the morning (old school carb loading). Like say a HIIT workout or something. \n\nThis keeps me from being hungry all the time, and really hits high on the nutrient density. The carbs are cycled and used to strategically top off my glycogen before bed when the insulin spike won’t increase my appetite.  I try to eat at least 3 servings of fermented food a day. I’ve been spreading a little miso on my buttered English muffin and it’s fire. Kimchi with grilled meat. Pickled anything with anything. I don’t remember what the study was, but the fermented foods are more important and beneficial than trying to mainline fiber. \n\nI don’t eat much processed food. Healthy fats to fuel, meat and vegetables to nourish, anything I missed or carbs I need in the third meal close to bed. Supplements are just krill oil and magnesium, creatine. Sometimes shilajit for the minerals. A lot of sea salt on the food. \n\nI just find that I run really well off fat and don’t get hungry, but I perform better for some activities if I top off glycogen the night before.",

However, more recent studies and meta analyses debunked that. Nutrient timing is insignificant when controlled for proper daily macro intake; some studies suggest an exception to this may be in elderly people, which may be age-related protein synthesis efficiency rather than other factors. \n\nAnother exception is higher intensity and/or endurance exercise - studies suggest this is when protein and carb timing can make a notable difference for performance, energy and recovery.",

    "combined_text": "Title: how important is nutrient timing compared to overall intake?\n\nPost: Hi everyone, I’ve been reading a lot about nutrient timing, like when to eat protein or carbs around workouts. but I’m wondering how much it really matters compared to just hitting your daily macros and calories.\n\nFrom a nutrition science perspective, does timing significantly impact muscle gain, fat loss, or energy levels? Or is it mostly a small factor compared to total intake?\n\nWould love to hear any research-backed insights or personal experiences!\n\nComments:\nHere is what works for me. It depends a lot on your goals and activity levels. I’m active and this is how I generally structure.  Has taken me a long time to dial this in, but it’s intuitive for me now.\n\n1. Wake up. Have an energy drink or a coffee and a b complex. \n2. Exercise. \n3. First meal. High on fat, low in carbs, a little bit of protein. Look looking to get 5-6 hours before the hunger sets in. Currently ricotta with grated tumeric/olive oil/black pepper, and some sort of toast with butter. The fat is great fuel. The fresh tumeric is good for you and there is a little protien in the ricotta.  \n4. Second meal. Largest meal. Meat and vegetables. Think steak and roasted brocolli. Something fermented. \n5. Third meal. More of a snack. Cheese and crackers and some nuts and pickles. Or granola and berries and Greek yogurt. Something fermented if possible. Maybe ice cream. Maybe cookies and milk. Carb level depends on amount of exercise planned the next morning.\n\nWhat I’ve done, or at least figured out, is a metabolically flexible path where I exercise fasted and fuel from fats (and my own fats) until later in the day. Next meal provides real nourishment and satiety. The snack optionally adds back in any carbs which can be strategically increased depending on what I’m doing in the morning (old school carb loading). Like say a HIIT workout or something. \n\nThis keeps me from being hungry all the time, and really hits high on the nutrient density. The carbs are cycled and used to strategically top off my glycogen before bed when the insulin spike won’t increase my appetite.  I try to eat at least 3 servings of fermented food a day. I’ve been spreading a little miso on my buttered English muffin and it’s fire. Kimchi with grilled meat. Pickled anything with anything. I don’t remember what the study was, but the fermented foods are more important and beneficial than trying to mainline fiber. \n\nI don’t eat much processed food. Healthy fats to fuel, meat and vegetables to nourish, anything I missed or carbs I need in the third meal close to bed. Supplements are just krill oil and magnesium, creatine. Sometimes shilajit for the minerals. A lot of sea salt on the food. \n\nI just find that I run really well off fat and don’t get hungry, but I perform better for some activities if I top off glycogen the night before.\n\nyour biggest ROI / big rocks when it comes to nutrient trimming:\n\n1) getting 3 meal in per day each with a solid bolus of protein (diminishing returns on muscle protein synthesis with further bolus)\n\n2) especially for females, not training fasted (regardless of goals). but if your goal specifically is  hypertrophy, then you shouldn’t be training fasted regardless.\n\nafter that, ensuring you’re eating within the peri- workout window, in the 5 hours around your workout, including workout time, is ideal.\n\nIt can differ between people, but only in terms of preference for the most part.\n\nFor myself, I perform best when I have quick carbs and protein before a workout - I feel more energized and sustained during things like long runs especially. My wife on the other hand, needs to have a buffer between her intake and exercise.\n\nOlder studies did suggest the benefit of an anabolic window. However, more recent studies and meta analyses debunked that. Nutrient timing is insignificant when controlled for proper daily macro intake; some studies suggest an exception to this may be in elderly people, which may be age-related protein synthesis efficiency rather than other factors. \n\nAnother exception is higher intensity and/or endurance exercise - studies suggest this is when protein and carb timing can make a notable difference for performance, energy and recovery.",

Protein -> carbs -> fat would be generally ideal for this goal for most people.\n\nYou should prioritize protein and carbs then fill the rest of your calories with fat\n\nIt really doesn’t matter. You’re going to need to eat sufficient protein, and you’ll need to fill in the rest of your surplus with some combination of fat and carbs.\n\nI found it more efficient to focus my macros around my training. So, I will eat more carbs around training and fewer in the evening as I wind down for the day. As a result, my dinners recently have been pretty much carb free with more protein and fat. This has the added benefit of keeping me full through the evening so I don't crave as many late night snacks.",

    "selftext": "You’ll be familiar with the wellness industry’s insistence on overcomplicating everything (usually for profit's sake).\n\nProtein guidance for recovery and muscle growth is an obvious example.\n\nSelf-proclaimed experts will try and push obscure ‘research’ to encourage you to buy their product or cause controversy on social media.\n\nThis post is all about the clear guidance you need to utilise protein to fuel your recovery and muscle growth.\n\n# Total Daily Protein is the Absolute Priority\n\nThe single most crucial factor for maximising muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and achieving muscle growth is the **overall amount of protein consumed throughout the entire day**. This concept is likened to a \"cake,\" with specific timing of protein intake being merely \"a very thin layer of icing\" on that cake.\n\nThere’s a clear hierarchy where meeting your total daily protein needs takes precedence over everything else. This means that even if protein intake is not perfectly distributed across meals, for instance, a smaller amount in the morning and a much larger, protein-rich dinner, the body can still effectively utilise that protein for muscle building, provided the daily total is met. Don’t think you need to front-load 50% of your protein requirement immediately after your workout.\n\n# Optimal Daily Protein Intake for Muscle Building\n\nFor most individuals aiming to build muscle through resistance training, the recommended total daily protein intake is approximately **1.6 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight**, which translates to about **0.7 grams per pound of body weight**. Some recommendations suggest going up to 2 grams per kilogram, or roughly 1 gram per pound, but these don’t factor in lean muscle mass, so are likely higher than necessary. A meta-analysis of existing literature concluded that as long as total daily protein intake was at or above this range, **the specific timing of protein consumption relative to a workout did not significantly impact muscle gain**.\n\n# The \"Anabolic Window\" is Very Flexible\n\nThe traditional notion of a narrow \"anabolic window,\" which suggested consuming protein and fast-digesting carbohydrates within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise, largely originated from studies where subjects trained in a completely fasted state. However, this concept has limited relevance for most people who consume meals before their workouts. When a mixed meal is eaten pre-exercise, its anabolic and anti-catabolic effects can last anywhere from three to six hours, meaning that **nutrients are often still circulating in the bloodstream during and even after a training session**.\n\nA comprehensive meta-analysis found that if the total daily protein intake is sufficient, the **exact timing of protein relative to the training session makes no meaningful difference** for muscle gain. Furthermore, the actual physiological \"anabolic window\" for muscle protein synthesis is much broader than just a few hours; it **peaks approximately 24 hours after resistance training and remains elevated for as long as 48 to 72 hours**. This indicates that the body has an extended period to utilise available nutrients for muscle repair and growth.\n\n# Meal Timing and Protein Portion Sizes\n\nResearch demonstrates considerable flexibility in when and how much protein one consumes per meal. A study showed **no significant advantage** between consuming protein immediately before exercise versus immediately after. Building on this, another trial specifically examined what happens when individuals neglect all nutrients for three hours both before and after a resistance training bout, while still optimising total daily protein. The results showed **no significant or meaningful difference in muscle size and strength gains** compared to a group that consumed protein immediately around their workout. This means there is **tremendous flexibility** in fitting protein intake into a busy schedule. While studies suggest that doses of around **30 to 50 grams per meal (or 0.4 to 0.6 grams per kilogram of body weight / 0.2 to 0.25 grams per pound of body weight)** appear to maximize muscle protein synthesis *per meal*, the body is also perfectly capable of effectively utilizing much larger protein amounts, such as **75 to 100 grams, from a single meal** for muscle protein synthesis. This is particularly helpful for individuals who find it more practical to consume a significant portion of their daily protein in one or two larger meals, such as dinner.\n\n# Nutrient Availability Trumps Ingestion Time\n\nThe crucial element for muscle protein synthesis is the **presence of nutrients in circulation**, not the precise moment those nutrients are ingested relative to your workout. Nutrients typically **peak in the bloodstream one to two hours after consumption**. Therefore, if you eat protein before a workout, those amino acids will become available in your system during or shortly after your training, ready for use by your muscles. This clarifies why a rush for immediate post-workout protein is often unnecessary, especially if a pre-workout meal has been consumed.\n\n\\---\n\nTaken from r / healthchallenges",

Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory glycoprotein naturally found in bovine colostrum and milk that is low in MR. Previous studies suggest that supplementing LF to MR enhances ADG and feed efficiency while reducing disease occurrence in pre-weaning dairy calves. In our experiment, 103 Holstein heifer calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a randomized complete block design from birth to d56 of age. Each calf received 340.1 g/d of 24% protein, 20% fat basal MR fed twice daily from d1 to 42 and once daily from d43 to 49, supplemented with 0 (L0), 1 (L1), 2 (L2) or 4 (L4) g/hd/d of LF treatment (45% purity). Calves were weaned at 49d of age. Body weight was measured at d1, 14, 28, 42, 49 and 56 of age. Faecal scores were measured weekly. Milk replacer and calf starter intake was measured daily and calculated biweekly. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model with fixed effects of LF inclusion, and random effects of source herd and nursery room. In the first two weeks of life, ADG and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) were numerically (non-statistically) increased in L4 tended compared with L1 and L2, but this effect was not maintained throughout the rest of the pre-weaning period or entire experiment. Average faecal score during the entire 56d experiment was greater in L2 compared with L0, L1 and L4, although faecal scores of all treatment groups were generally low. Under the conditions of the present study, LF supplementation at the inclusion levels provided showed minimal effects on feed intake, growth rate or calf health.",

The HGD enzyme forms a complex hexameric structure (dimer of trimers), which is highly susceptible to destabilization by missense mutations, accounting for 64.2% of AKU-causing variants. Current treatment with nitisinone (NTBC) in combination with a low-protein diet, is associated with severe side effects, underscoring the unmet need for alternative therapies. To explore pharmacological chaperones that stabilize mutant HGD and restore enzymatic activity, we developed and optimized a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay in Escherichia coli expressing human HGD variants. The assay quantifies time-dependent formation of maleylacetoacetate, the product of homogentisic acid conversion, and was validated for robustness (Z'-value > 0.4, Signal window > 2). We screened a library of 2,320 FDA-approved drugs and identified 30 compounds that increased the catalytic activity of the prevalent HGD",

Syncytin-1, an endogenous retroviral envelope protein specifically expressed in placental trophoblasts, is diminished in preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. This study aimed to investigate the effects of low syncytin-1 expression on placental transport of amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol, and its implications for fetal and placental development, contributing to fetal growth restriction pathogenesis. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice received tamoxifen-induced conditional syncytin-a gene knockout at embryonic day 11.5, with controls receiving sunflower oil. Placentas and fetuses were collected analyzed for transport efficiency. Parallelly, siRNA-mediacted syncytin-1 knockdown in BeWo cells assessed trophoblast dysfunction. Nutritional content and the expression of relevant transporters for amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol, were all evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Using conditionally induced syncytin-a gene knockout mouse models, we found that syncytin-A deficiency resulted in decreased fetal and placental weights, reduced placental labyrinthine layer area and syncytiotrophoblast layer structural defects. Placental amino acid (SNAT2, LAT1), fatty acid (CD36, FABP4, FATP4), and cholesterol (LDLR, SR-B1) transporters were dysregulated, aligning with altered nutrient levels in knockout mice. Similar dysfunction in amino acid and fatty acid transport was observed in syncytin-1-silenced BeWo cells. Mechanistically, syncytin-1 deficiency suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, a key pathway modulating nutrient sensing and transporter activity. Our experiments demonstrate that syncytin-1 regulates the transport of amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol in placental trophoblastic cells, providing new insights into the pathological role of decreased syncytin-1 in pregnancy-related disorders, particularly in fetal growth restriction.",

Ascher flower is a traditional anti-inflammatory Chinese medicine, recognized for its therapeutic effect on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, its mechanisms against BPH are still unclear.\n\nThis study aims to elucidate the active fractions of H. plantaginea flower responsible for anti-BPH effects and their underlying mechanisms.\n\nThe chemical constituents in fractions of H. plantaginea flower were rapidly identified using UHPLC-MS. The anti-BPH efficacies of the effect fractions were evaluated in testosterone propionate (TP)-induced RWPE-1 cells and rat models. Metabolomics and bioinformatics analyses were used to identify potential metabolic and signaling pathways, which were validated by Western blotting.\n\nA total of 26, 38, and 23 phytochemicals were fleetly identified from HPA, HPB, and HPC fractions, respectively. The petroleum ether fraction (HPA), ethyl acetate fraction (HPB), and butanol fraction (HPC) of H. plantaginea flower exhibite significant anti-BPH effects at equivalent doses of the raw H. plantaginea flower herb (1 and 4 g/kg), including reductions in prostate enlargement, wet weight, and prostatic index, along with improvements in damaged prostate tissue. Additionally, these fractions significantly increased testosterone levels and decreased dihydrotestosterone, 5α-reductase, and epidermal growth factor levels in prostate tissue. In addition, HPA and HPB fractions possess anti-BPH activities in vitro. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that HPA, HPB, and HPC reversed 33 differential metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism and the regulation of AMPK/JNK pathways, as well as their downstream STAT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB pathways. Mechanistically, HPA, HPB, and HPC significantly inhibited the overexpression of phosphorylated proteins, including AMPKα1, JAK1, STAT3, PI3K p85, Akt1, JNK, p38, Erk, p65, and IκBα.\n\nH. plantaginea flower exhibits significant anti-BPH effect by inhibiting the AMPK/JNK signaling pathways and regulating amino acid metabolism. HPA, HPB, and HPC were identified as the major effect fractions, with fatty acids and flavonoids as potential pharmacodynamic substances. These findings offer a scientific basis for the clinical application of H. plantaginea flower in treating BPH and provide groundwork for developing BPH treatments based on this herb.",

In this study, we observed that MC-LR disrupted acrosome biogenesis, a critical process for sperm function. Mechanistically, MC-LR induced proteasomal degradation of Golgi-associated PDZ- and coiled-coil motif-containing protein (GOPC), a key acrosome assembly protein, by disrupting its ubiquitin homeostasis. This degradation resulted from dual inhibition of MC-LR on the deubiquitinase ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3). MC-LR directly bound to catalytic domain of UCHL3, obstructing its interaction with GOPC and inhibiting its enzymatic activity. MC-LR was also found to suppresses UCHL3 transcription and destabilizes UCHL3 protein stability. Further studies showed that UCHL3 dysfunction triggered excessive GOPC ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction. Our study provided the first mechanistic evidence linking an environmental toxin (MC-LR) to ubiquitination-dependent failure of spermiogenesis, specifically through GOPC degradation. We identified disruption of the UCHL3-GOPC regulatory axis as a novel etiological pathway in MC-LR-induced male infertility, highlighting this axis as a promising therapeutic target for chemical-induced reproductive dysfunction.",

Protein kinases evolved in eukaryotes as important mediators of cell signalling that target specific amino acid side chains to modulate downstream protein function. Among them, the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a family of intracellular protein kinases that form signalling cascades responding to a number of stimuli, that control fundamental mechanisms such as proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death. Signals propagate through consecutive kinases which eventually phosphorylate and activate a MAPK. Here, we show that the dual specificity threonine/tyrosine MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs) are able to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs using ADP as well as ATP in vitro. As the pathways are involved in the stress response, we speculate that it would represent an advantage to be able to maintain signalling under conditions such as hypoxia, that occur under a number of cell stresses, including cancer and atherosclerosis, where the available pool of ATP could be depleted.",

The MA of lysine was estimated by comparing the IAAO response to varying intakes of lysine in cooked millet compared with IAAO response to L-lysine in the reference protein (crystalline amino acid) using slope ratio analysis.\n\nThe SID and MA of lysine in cooked millet was 83%and 96% respectively.\n\nThis is the first study to provide SID and IAAO estimates of MA in the same food assessed in the same animals. The SID estimates are within ranges published by the National Research Council and the IAAO derived BA estimate for lysine is the same as previously published in humans.

Currently, research on the ghrelin is primarily focused on a single species, and there have been no systematic studies on the evolution of the ghrelin in fish. Therefore, this thesis conducts a comprehensive analysis of the ghrelin gene in 151 species of ray-finned bony fishes to reveal the universality and specificity of the ghrelin gene in the evolutionary history of fish, supplementing and perfecting the information on the ghrelin gene in Actinopterygii. The gene identification results show that the number of ghrelin genes varies among different fish species, 41 fish have lost the ghrelin gene, 98 fish having one ghrelin gene, and 12 fish having two ghrelin genes. Among the 110 fish species with the ghrelin gene, a total of 182 ghrelin gene sequences were identified, with transcript variant numbers ranging from 1 to 6, encoding 1 to 3 types of isoform proteins, and their mature peptides show a certain degree of similarity across different species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that teleost ghrelin proteins segregate into three major evolutionary clades, with Salmoniformes orthologs comprising a distinct monophyletic cluster. The Cladistic and Chondrostei are clustered separately and then grouped with the more ancient Cypriniformes and Siluriformes species from the Neopterygii into a large group, while the other fish species from the Neopterygii form another large group. The Synteny analysis results indicate that the upstream gene of the ghrelin is CCDC174, and the downstream gene is TATDN2. The selection pressure analysis results show that there are no positive selection sites in the ghrelin gene, indicating that the ghrelin has been under strong functional constraint during the evolutionary process of fish. This study systematically investigates the evolutionary history of fish ghrelin, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the function and status of ghrelin in the feeding regulation system of fish, and deepening the recognition of its structural and functional evolution in the process of energy metabolism evolution.",

We therefore investigated the acute changes in amino acid metabolism during sepsis in a pig model. We studied 51 pigs using a pulse stable isotope tracer method to measure kinetic changes in almost all amino acids before and 6.5 h after sepsis induction by continuous infusion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Statistics were done by Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Sepsis induced only small (<10 %) changes in plasma concentration of amino acids, while amino acid clearance was substantially increased for amino acids like taurine (+33 %), histidine (+42 %), glycine (+35 %), glutamine (+27 %), arginine (+13 %) and citrulline (+20 %), while reduced for tyrosine (-11 %), threonine (-11 %), lysine (-14 %). Compartmental analysis revealed that changes in extra- and intracellular amino acid pools and fluxes were much larger than the changes in plasma concentrations. Intracellular pool sizes were substantially lower for glutamate (-47 %), lysine (-46 %), phenylalanine (-39 %), threonine (-33 %), and tyrosine (-28 %) and higher for taurine (+21 %), hydroxyproline (+31 %) and glutamine (+35 %). Notably, intracellular productions of essential amino acids like lysine (-49 %), phenylalanine (-25 %), threonine (-26 %), tryptophan (-22 %), and tyrosine (-22 %) were significantly reduced during sepsis, while those of taurine (+24 %) and glutamine (+34 %) were increased, suggesting attenuated protein breakdown in the early phase of sepsis. Plasma cytokine levels, including IL1-beta (+50 %), IL1-ra (+120 %), IL6 (+26 %), and TNF-alpha (+9 %), were also statistically significantly elevated. Large changes in intracellular amino acid metabolism occur relatively quickly during the development of sepsis, while changes in plasma concentration are small. Therefore, compartmental analysis of amino acid metabolism shows that changes in the extra- and intracellular pools and fluxes into these pools seems to precede the changes in plasma concentrations, indicating that amino acid metabolism is affected much more and sooner than could be concluded from measuring plasma concentrations only.",

The intensity of the inflammatory response appears as the principal driver of the changes involved in outcome, and especially those affecting protein metabolism and muscle catabolism, and resistance to nutrition. The present exploratory study aims to clarify the role of the different cytokines in amino acid metabolism.\n\nIn this post-hoc analysis of the previously published observational study, including 51 critically ill patients and 49 healthy controls aiming at identifying patient changes in amino acid metabolism, we assessed the association between a panel of cytokines and blood levels of amino acids (AA) and their turnover. The subjects were matched for age, sex, and BMI. The study was conducted in postabsorptive state. Blood analysis included cytokines (determined by Luminex), C-reactive protein (CRP or hsCRP), and AA.\n\n8 mL solution containing 18 stable AA tracers administered as a pulse to calculate amino acid whole body production (WBP). WBP was calculated from fitted decay curves. We measured amino acid enrichments and concentrations by LC-MS/MS and derived statistics using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) t and stepwise regression.

Using a 3-factor, 5-level central composite design (CCD) within a response surface methodology (RSM) framework, 960 male broilers were randomly divided into 16 treatments, each comprising 6 replicates with 10 birds per replicate. The treatments included a control group (Con) fed a 19 % CP diet, and 15 dietary treatments with graded levels of dLys (0.97-1.23 %), dMet (0.43-0.53 %), and dThr (0.64-0.84 %). Results indicated that dLys had the strongest linear effect on body weight gain (BWG; P < 0.001). The optimal SID ratios were determined as dMet/dLys = 0.41 (0.468 %/1.145 %) and dThr/dLys = 0.64 (0.730 %/1.145 %) for BWG, and dMet/dLys = 0.38 (0.454 %/1.180 %) and dThr/dLys = 0.64 (0.757 %/1.180 %) for FCR. These optimizations enabled a 10.5 % reduction in dietary CP level without compromising growth performance, along with a 32.3 % decrease in nitrogen (N) excretion compared with the Con group. Furthermore, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of amino acids (AA) improved significantly compared with the Con group (P < 0.001).

Growth performance in poultry, particularly broilers, plays a critical role in production efficiency. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a multifunctional hormone which shows promotive effects on growth and development. Traditional IGF-1 delivery methods, such as injections or dietary supplements, face practical limitations including high cost, multiple dosages and rapid degradation. To explore a more efficient IGF-1 delivery method for promoting chicken growth, we generated a recombinant herpesvirus of turkey expressing chicken IGF-1, rHVT-chIGF-1. A single dose of rHVT-chIGF-1 was administered intramuscularly to broilers at day 1 of age. Growth performance parameters, including body weight (BW) and average daily weight gain (ADG) was assessed over a 42-day period.

Additionally, the mRNA expression of muscle development-related genes was significantly upregulated in the rHVT-chIGF-1 group.

This was driven by the expression of the R2R3 MYB transcription factor (TF) gene PpMYB10.1. Transcriptome and degradome sequencing were used to identify the regulatory network upstream of PpMYB10.1. We identified and functionally verified that NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) TFs PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 are activators of anthocyanin accumulation. Protein-protein/DNA interaction assays were conducted, and it was observed that both PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 could form homodimers to directly activate the PpMYB10.1 promoter. Degradome analysis showed cleavage of PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 transcripts occurred via miR164a. Compared with peel and OF, a lower expression of miR164a in IF resulted in higher expression of PpNAC22 and PpNAC100. Functional characterisation showed that overexpression of miR164a significantly reduced anthocyanin accumulation driven by PpNAC22 and PpNAC100. Furthermore, another NAC TF, PpNAC29, was identified to be indirectly involved in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation. PpNAC29 formed a heterodimer with PpNAC22, although it could not bind to the PpMYB10.1 promoter.

However, the association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) remains unknown.\n\nTo explore the association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of PCAD and severity of PCAD.\n\nThis multi-center case-control study was conducted in the framework of the Iran Premature Coronary Artery Disease (IPAD) study in 14 cities in Iran. The data were collected from hospitals with catheterization laboratories. Cases were 1435 patients with a stenosis ≥ 75% in at least one vessel or ≥ 50% in the left main artery. Control group were 711 individuals with normal angiography test. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We calculated the proportion of daily energy intake contributed by plant and animal protein separately, and then derived a unitless plant-to-animal protein ratio by dividing these 2%. The association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of PCAD and its severity was investigated using logistics regression.\n\nThe mean (SD) of plant-to-animal protein ratio was 1.06 (0.44). In the fully adjusted model, the highest tertile of the plant-to-animal protein ratio was significantly associated with a decreased risk of PCAD compared with the lowest tertile (OR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.22-0.43, P trend < 0.001). There was an inverse relationship between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the severity of PCAD (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.47-0.77, P trend < 0.001).\n\nOur results revealed an inverse association between the plant-to-animal protein ratio and the risk of PCAD and its severity. More future studies are needed to confirm this association.",

To date, the optimal intensity of PRT and the added value of dietary protein for enhancing muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in frail older adults remain unclear. This randomised controlled trial aims to determine the efficacy of various PRT intensities and adequate dietary protein intake in improving muscle mass, strength and physical performance in frail, community-dwelling older adults.\n\nThis study is a two-step randomised clinical trial involving 300 frail older adults. Participants will engage in a 12-week PRT twice weekly. Initially, participants will be randomised to specific training intensities, ranging from 20 to 80% of their one-repetition maximum (1-RM). Subsequently, participants will be further randomised into two groups: an intervention group receiving a dietary intervention targeting a daily protein intake of 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day (PRT-Pro), and a control group with no dietary intervention (PRT-only). The dietary protein intervention will include counselling sessions and the provision of protein-rich foods.\n\nThis study aims to elucidate the effect of various PRT intensities and the supplementary effects of adequate dietary protein intake on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in frail older adults. The results will provide critical insights for scientists and healthcare professionals, facilitating the development of more effective strategies to combat sarcopenia and frailty in this population.\n\nThe trial is registered at the ICTRP (OMON trial ID NL8785).",

Traditional methods rely on Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks and limited biological feature data, often neglecting the critical role of protein amino acid sequences. To address this, we propose the HCNS model, which integrates the Hypergraph Convolutional Network (HGCN) module, the Seq-CNN-MB-NAG feature extraction module, and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) recognition module, significantly enhancing the accuracy of essential protein identification. The HGCN module constructs a hypergraph from the PPI network and protein complex data, capturing the complex structural relationships between proteins. The Seq-CNN-MB-NAG module utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and NAG Transformer to process protein amino acid sequences and extract sequence features. The MLP module then fuses these two sets of features for precise recognition. Experimental results show that the HCNS model outperforms existing methods, achieving an accuracy of 93.38%, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.33% and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR) of 97.16%, demonstrating its potential in essential protein identification.",

To address this, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the potential response mechanisms in tilapia subjected to both factors. Tilapia were fed normal (NC) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 90 days, then challenged with S. agalactiae. At 48 h post-infection, blood, liver, and spleen samples were collected for biochemical parameter analysis and gene expression profiling. The results indicated that the combined treatment upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (pparα) and fatty acid transport protein 1 (fatp1). Concurrently, it increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (hmgcr) expression, while decreasing cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (cyp7a1) expression compared to HFD alone. Antioxidant status analysis revealed that the combined treatment decreased glutathione (GSH) content, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (nqo1), and glutathione peroxidase 3 (gpx3). Intriguingly, while both individual stressors upregulated inflammatory and immune-related genes, their combination suppressed interleukin-1β (il-1β), il-8, and immunoglobulin M (igm) expression compared to infection alone. The apoptotic response triggered by S. agalactiae infection, characterized by elevated caspase-3 (cas3), cas9, and cytochrome c (cytc), was inhibited in the liver of combined treatment group. Moreover, all experimental groups showed elevated expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (ire1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (eif2ak3), activating transcription factor 6 (atf6), and binding immunoglobulin protein (bip). These findings collectively demonstrated that HFD exacerbated the pathogenic effects of S. agalactiae through multiple mechanisms, including metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress potentiation, and complex immunomodulation. Furthermore, the Nrf2 and NF-kB signaling pathways may be implicated in mediating these adverse effects.",

Compared with single-frequency ultrasound (SFU), multiple-frequency ultrasound with dual frequency (DFU) and triple-frequency (TFU) dramatically improved the functional characteristics of SPI. Among them, DFU-assisted germination (DFUG) was the most efficient strategy, which not only increased the solubility (29.15 %), water-holding ability (20.74 %), foaming and emulsifying capacity of SPI (35.24 %, and 167.16 %, respectively), but also improved its tertiary structure, with maximum particle size (1225 nm), higher zeta-potential (-52 mv), suitable surface hydrophobicity (5638), and the highest structural orderliness (lowest random coil content, 12.36 %), free sulfhydryl content (10 μmol/L). Correlation analysis revealed that these changes in SPI molecular structure are the critical factors in enhancing its functional properties. Moreover, DFUG improved the nutritional values of SPI via regulating the amino acid composition and gastrointestinal digestibility.

A peptidomics approach based on mass spectrometry, combined with high-throughput molecular docking, was employed to predict peptide interactions with the IgE fragment of antigen binding. Seven antigenic epitopes and 22 key amino acids were identified from BLG-derived peptides, and five antigenic epitopes and 18 key amino acids were identified from ALA-derived peptides. The allergenicity of synthetic epitopes ranged from 40 % to 80 %, and the dissociation constant between epitopes and IgE ranged from 17.90 nM to 279.01 nM, confirming their strong IgE-binding potential.

With an average egg production of 40 eggs per season and yielding 58.59% carcass on live weight, ostriches offer substantial economic benefits. The nutritional needs of ostriches evolve across different life stages, impacting growth and reproductive performance. As herbivores capable of digesting high-fiber diets, ostriches thrive on roughage and pasture, with a digestive system similar to other poultry. Essential nutrients, including 20-24% crude protein (CP) and 12-19% crude fiber, are critical for optimal development, particularly in early growth, where their feed conversion ratio is 2:1. As ostriches reach sexual maturity, maintaining a diet rich in amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrates becomes vital for optimizing fertility and reproductive performance. This review provides a detailed overview of ostrich nutrient requirements across different growth stages, focusing on how energy and protein levels affect overall growth and productivity. It also explores the importance of feeding management practices in enhancing ostrich health and performance, offering insights for improving commercial ostrich farming.",

Six hundred Cobb500 day-old-chicks were allocated to five dietary treatments: Standard broiler diet, with no inclusion of AGPs (NegControl); Standard broiler diet, with inclusion of AGPs (PosControl); Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % probiotics (Prob); Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % stimbiotics (Stim) and Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % probiotics and 0.01 % stimbiotics) (ProbStim). Each dietary treatment was replicated 8 times, with a pen holding 15 birds as the experimental unit. The experimental trial was conducted over three feeding phases: starter phase (day 1- 14), grower phase (day 15- 28) and finisher phase (day 29- 42). The birds were subjected to heat stress in the grower phase and finisher phase for 3 h (11:00- 14:00 h). Diet had no effect on ADFI in the starter, grower and finisher phase. Similarly, diet had no effect on ADG and FCR in both grower and finisher phase. The cumulative weight gain was consistently low in broiler chickens fed the Stim diet throughout the feeding phases, while those fed Prob diet had higher weights in week 2 and to 6. Dietary treatments did not affect protein consumed, protein efficiency ratio, specific growth rate and growth efficiency across all the feeding phases. Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were significantly affected by diet (P < 0.05) with broiler chickens fed PosControl in non- stressed environment having the highest total cholesterol (3.90± 0.18) and triglyceride level (1.77± 0.12). With regards to behavioral response to heat stress induced discomfort, broilers fed PosControl (2.33±0.26) and Prob (2.33±0.26) exhibited increased pecking feed activity and increased tendencies of seeking cooler areas. Overall, the birds did not show signs of severe stress.

Exposure to high concentrations of ABA during seed germination resulted in the identification of 23 putative mutant lines, which were re-evaluated to select those with the strongest ABA-insensitive phenotype. Whole-genome resequencing of ABA-sensitive and -insensitive plants of the selected mutant line 2087 revealed a G > A transition in a gene encoding the phosphatase 2C protein clade H CpPP2C-H1A as responsible for the ABA-insensitive phenotype. The so-called pp2c-h1a mutation resulted in the substitution of E345K in a conserved amino acid within a conserved motif of plant PP2Cs. The mutation did not alter the germination rate in water, but favored germination in the presence of ABA. The pp2c-h1a mutation increased water loss under various stress conditions, while increasing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and preventing stomatal closure in response to external ABA treatments. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR revealed that the transcripts of CpPP2C-H1A and its paralog CpPP2C-H1B accumulated similarly in all tissues analyzed. The transcription of both genes was not altered by the pp2c-h1a mutation. The transcription of CpPP2C-H1A did not change in response to treatments with ABA, cold, PEG, and NaCl in seedling leaves, and that of CpPP2C-H1B changed only in response to cold. However, the expression of both genes was up-regulated in seeds after imbibition and germination and was significantly induced by NaCl treatment in germinated seeds. Taken together, these data indicate that CpPP2C-H1A acts as a negative regulator of ABA signaling in germination inhibition and stomatal closure under adverse conditions.",

    "combined_text": "Deciphering autophagy signaling in cancer: A paradigm shift from molecular classifications to clinical innovations.\n\nThe intracellular breakdown process known as autophagy occurs when cells experience adverse conditions, such as organelle damage, the presence of abnormal proteins, hypoxia stress, low energy levels, or nutritional deprivation. The autophagic process begins by forming autophagosomes, which then merge with lysosomes to recycle degraded materials. Autophagy functions in multiple ways to affect cancer development and treatment outcomes. Tumor cells with low autophagy levels may exhibit anti-tumor effects during cancer initiation because their connection to malignant transformation is possible. The promotion of autophagy appears beneficial for cancer prevention in this context. The survival of cancer cells through increased autophagy enables tumor growth in existing tumors by allowing them to overcome metabolic and treatment-related challenges. Research indicates that blocking autophagy through the use of drugs or genetic methods makes cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies, suggesting that inhibiting the autophagic system may be a promising approach to enhance treatment. Excessive autophagy activation could be a therapeutic approach to manage cancer cells that resist cell death. The successful treatment of cancer requires an understanding of autophagy's dual nature. This review examines potential therapeutic strategies for tumors by analyzing autophagy-related signaling pathways and the essential factors that influence cancer development.",

Here, we present a multi-tiered systems biology framework to investigate the anti-metastatic potential of enterolactone (EL), integrating computational, transcriptomic, and experimental approaches in the MDA-MB-231 TNBC model. Network pharmacology identified 78 EL-metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) overlapping targets as potential therapeutic targets of EL against mTNBC, with PPI and GMFA network enrichment uncovering key metastasis-associated pathways including Notch, TGF-β, TNF, and ErbB signaling. Molecular docking and 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations revealed stable binding of EL to several core oncogenic proteins (e.g., EGFR, PARP1, AURKB, SMAD4, CDK4), suggesting poly-pharmacological engagement. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of EL-treated cells coupled with GSEA revealed coordinated downregulation of oncogenic programs including E2F, G2/M checkpoint, MYC targets, EMT, and metabolic plasticity, alongside induction of NRF2 signaling and ferroptosis. This study reports, for the first time, transcriptome-wide effects of EL in MDA-MB-231 cells, linking its activity to the repression of stemness, invasion, and immune-evasive traits. Experimental validation via qPCR confirmed EL-mediated suppression of key molecular targets of TGF-β and Notch signaling pathways. EL also impaired cortactin expression and disrupted cytoskeletal remodeling, validated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry studies, indicating attenuation of invasive machinery. Furthermore, EL reduced metastatic dissemination in a zebrafish xenograft model, reinforcing its in vivo anti-metastatic potential. Together, our integrative study elucidates EL's multitarget mechanism against metastatic TNBC and highlights its translational promise as a systems-level modulator of oncogenic signaling. These findings warrant further in-depth mechanistic investigations to validate EL's therapeutic potential.",

Excreted N can be lost to the environment as ammonia gas leading to environmental acidification and nutrient enrichment of sensitive habitats, and to watercourses contributing to aquatic eutrophication. While there is much evidence that NUE can be improved by reducing the crude protein (CP) content of dairy cow diets, the long-term impacts of feeding lower protein diets on cow performance and the rumen microbiome are less well understood. This study examined the effects of reducing the CP contents of dairy cow diets on cow performance, NUE, the relationship between NUE and residual feed intake (RFI), and the rumen microbiome.\n\nDietary CP content did not affect feed intake, milk yield or milk composition (P > 0.05), except for milk urea N (MUN), which increased with increasing diet CP content (P < 0.05).

The aim was to explore the association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and nutrient intake and adequacy among 70-year-old adults in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nThis cross-sectional study included 861 participants from the Swedish population-based Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study (mean age 70.5 years, 55% women). Dietary intake was assessed using a validated diet history interview, and adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was scored based on 14 food components. Nutrient intake was evaluated against age- and sex-specific recommended intake (RI) levels. Cardiometabolic risk markers and biomarkers of nutritional status, including homocysteine and haemoglobin, were measured. Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine trends across sex-specific tertiles of diet adherence, with sensitivity analyses adjusting for energy intake and comparing adequacy based on average requirement (AR) thresholds.\n\nHigher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was linked to higher intake of fibre and polyunsaturated fats, and lower intake of saturated fat and alcohol. Mean protein intake per kilogram body weight/day was similar across adherence tertiles. Intake of beta-carotene, folate, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and iron was higher with greater adherence, while retinol equivalents, vitamin B12, niacin equivalents was lower- patterns that remained consistent after energy adjustment. Despite lower B12 intake, homocysteine levels were lowest in the group with highest adherence, and anaemia prevalence did not differ. Micronutrient adequacy improved with higher adherence for vitamin E, folate, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and iron. Similar results were observed using average requirement (AR) thresholds in sensitivity analyses.\n\nAdherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was associated with a more favourable nutrient profile in this cohort of older adults, without evidence of widespread micronutrient inadequacy. These findings suggest that environmentally sustainable diets can support adequate nutrition when well-balanced, even in nutritionally vulnerable populations such as older adults.",

Coptisine is a bioactive component of Rhizoma coptidis with anti-diabetes property. The aim of this present study was to clarify the role and possible mechanism of coptisine underlying VEC dysfunction during gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with coptisine and/or high glucose (HG) medium. A GDM rat model was established by high-fat diet feeding and streptozotocin injection. Cell viability, migration, and angiogenesis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, wound healing assay, Transwell assay, and tube formation assay. The levels of angiogenesis-related proteins and the key markers in the Adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK)/nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway were tested by western blot analysis. The pathological changes of placental tissues were observed by HE staining. We found that the cell viability of HUVECs was repressed in HG conditions in a dose-dependent manner, and 25 mM HG reduced the HUVEC viability in a time-dependent manner. Coptisine (5 to 5o μM) did not cause cytotoxicity to HUVECs. In addition, HG-induced the decrease in cell viability and migration of HUVECs were rescued by coptisine in a dose-dependent manner. Coptisine restored the angiogenetic ability of HG-induced HUVECs by upregulating the protein expression of fibroblast growth factor 2, vascular endothelial-derived growth factor, and Angiotensin 1. Moreover, coptisine treatment re-activated the AMPK/NRF2 pathway in HG-stimulated HUVECs. Importantly, inhibition of AMPK/NRF2 signaling reverses the effect of coptisine on cell viability, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs. The in vivo study demonstrated that coptisine suppresses hyperglycemia and placenta injury in GDM rats. Coptisine protected HUVECs from hyperglycemic insult, suggesting the potential of coptisine which might be used as a therapeutic agent for VEC dysfunction in GDM.",

Twenty yearling male Dawuro lambs were assigned to four treatments in a randomized complete block design: T1 (0% DDLM, control), T2 (30% DDLM), T3 (50% DDLM), and T4 (70% DDLM), with grass hay as the basal diet and 100 g/day ground maize. In a 10-day digestibility trial and 90-day feeding period, DDLM showed higher crude protein (CP, 17.74%) than grass hay (7.98%) and maize (8.40%) (P < 0.01). Total dry matter (DM) intake rose from 631.68 g/day (T1) to 957.39 g/day (T4) (P < 0.01), with nutrient absorption increasing from 57.10% (T1) to 71.40% (T4) (P < 0.05). Diets with 50% and 70% DDLM improved organic matter, CP, and fiber absorption (P < 0.05). DDLM's high protein content, local availability, and low cost reduce feed expenses, yielding a net return of ETB 183.38 per sheep (Dillo et al. 2024). Further research should investigate higher inclusion levels, reproductive performance, and carcass quality.",

This study employed a genome-wide screen of Escherichia coli K-12 Keio single-gene knockout library (3,985 mutants) to identify genes modulating tCA response. Mutants were screened on LB medium supplemented with tCA (0-1.5 mg/mL). Phenotypic analysis identified 78 sensitive and 52 resistant mutants, validated through visual and quantitative assessments. Sequential spot assays under tCA stress confirmed classifications: sensitive mutants (e.g., ∆aaeX, ∆aaeA, ∆seqA, ∆vacJ, ∆dksA) displayed growth inhibition, while resistant mutants (e.g., ∆yhfK, ∆hofQ, ∆ybaT, ∆groL) exhibited enhanced growth. Mutants were categorized into High, Moderate, or Low Sensitivity/Resistance groups using integrated data from SGA Tools, genome-wide screening (GWS), and spot testing, yielding 18 High Sensitive (HS), 43 Moderate Sensitive (MS), 17 Low Sensitive (LS), 20 High Resistant (HR), 23 Moderate Resistant (MR), and 9 Low Resistant (LR) strains. Complementation of sensitive mutants (e.g., ∆dksA, ∆seqA, ∆aaeA, ∆vacJ) with wild-type alleles via plasmids restored growth and elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), directly linking these genes to tCA sensitivity. Functional evaluation (EcoCyc, DAVID, STRING) revealed HS gene hits were associated with transcriptional regulation, metabolic activity, protein folding, DNA repair, transport, and membrane stability. Resistant gene hits were linked to stress response and detoxification pathways.

The fibrils of MBP extracted from the brain are detected by electron microscopy and exhibit apple-green birefringence after Congo Red staining. We showed that the central region of MBP, spanning amino acid residues 60-119, is responsible for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Based on these data, we present a model in which MBP not only connects the opposite membranes of oligodendrocyte processes but also provides longitudinal amyloid stitching of myelin sheaths.

Given the high relapse risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), understanding its progression mechanisms and identifying prognostic biomarkers are crucial for improving treatment outcomes. Here, we applied a mitochondrial single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing mitochondria single-cell ATAC-seq (mtscATAC-seq), supplemented with single-cell RNA-seq, to comprehensively characterize AML cells. By constructing a single-cell hematopoiesis reference and mapping tumor cells to it, we identified significant alterations in chromatin accessibility of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) associated with AML differentiation. Using an in-house developed algorithm, cisGRN, we analyzed CRE dynamics and discovered that mutations in the zinc finger domain of WT1 are associated with decreased chromatin accessibility and hypermethylation at the regulatory regions of their target genes, leading to gene downregulation. Functional validation confirmed the pathogenic effects of five WT1 zinc finger mutations: R467Q, R467L, R467W, H470Y, and H470R. Additionally, we identified a CRE mutation that emerges early in hematopoiesis, introducing a new binding motif for CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB), which facilitates its binding to the enhancer, activating enhancer activity and GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) expression, thereby promoting AML proliferation. These effects were validated through luciferase reporter assays and prime editing experiments. Using mitochondria DNA tracing and machine learning modeling, we identified relapse-associated clones resembling leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and uncovered marker genes in the clones that more accurately predict drug resistance and relapse risk. Collectively, our findings underscore the utility of combining mtscATAC-seq, lineage tracing, and gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis to uncover aberrant regulatory changes and track relapse-prone AML clones.",

    "combined_text": "Genetic and physiological influences on the rumen microbiome and metabolic status in Holstein cows.\n\nMetabolic disorders in cows occur when physiological metabolic processes are disrupted, often due to nutritional imbalances. These disorders can significantly affect productivity, particularly in high-producing dairy breeds, such as Holsteins, especially during critical periods, including transition and early lactation. A key factor influencing nutritional efficiency is the rumen microbiome, which plays a vital role in fiber digestion, starch fermentation, and the production of VFA, as well as in microbial protein synthesis and vitamin synthesis. Given its importance in maintaining energy and nitrogen balance, this study aimed to identify associations between rumen microbiome composition and the concentration of ketone bodies and liver enzymes in the blood serum, both of which serve as markers of metabolic disorders. The bacterial phyla and genera associated with metabolic markers were further analyzed for correlations with genetic markers through a microbiome GWAS. Additionally, the study examined how parity and lactation progression (DIM) influence the rumen microbiome. The results revealed that both parity and DIM were associated with blood metabolic markers' concentration, with rumen microbiome composition varying throughout lactation and across parities. Several phyla and genera abundances were significantly associated with metabolic markers, notably Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group, Erysipelotrichaceae UCG_006 (Firmicutes), and Bsconditabacteriales S.R1 (Patescibacteria). The microbiome GWAS identified 3 SNPs with genome-wide significance for the Elusimicrobiota, Planctomycetota, and Verrucomicrobiota phyla, as well as 10 significant SNPs for the Asteroleplasma and Succinivibrio genera. The mean SNP-based heritability for phyla associated with metabolic markers was 0.287, with several taxa exhibiting heritability estimates above 0.2. This study highlights that specific ruminal bacteria are associated with the energy balance and metabolic status of cows, in relation to parity and DIM. Moreover, some of these bacteria are influenced by host genetic factors and could potentially be modified through selective breeding.",

Sixty-four neonatal calves (40.6 ± 4.3 kg BW; 48 females and 16 males) were allocated to a randomized complete block design stratified by birth weight, birth date, and sex. Starter feed was provided ad libitum from d 4 until weaning. Treatments included a control (no PM supplementation in milk) and milk combined with PM supplement at 10, 20, or 40 g/d. The results revealed that feed efficiency, body length, or heart girth did not significantly differ among treatments. However, BW, DMI, ADG, wither height, and shank circumference increased linearly with increasing PM supplementation, while diarrhea frequency decreased linearly from d 4 to 15. Ruminal ammonia-nitrogen and molar proportions of individual VFA were not significantly affected by PM supplementation, while ruminal pH and total VFA showed a linear decrease and increase with increasing PM, respectively. Similarly, serum glucose, BUN, total protein, albumin, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, IL-6, and IgM were not significantly affected by PM supplementation, while triglyceride concentrations showed quadratic and cubic decreases with increasing PM. The IGF-1 concentration, total antioxidant capacity, and IL-10 concentration increased linearly, while tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations increased quadratically with increasing PM supplementation. In conclusion, PM additions improved the growth performance of preweaning Holstein calves and reduced diarrhea frequency, with PM supplementation of 40 g/d exerting the most significant effect.",

YrU1 was identified through map-based cloning in Triticum urartu accession PI428309, the progenitor species of the A genome of hexaploid wheat. Despite its established role in conferring Pst resistance, the molecular mechanisms and interacting components involved in YrU1-mediated immunity remain largely undefined. In this study, we identified TuNHL1, a plasma membrane-localized NDR1/HIN1-like (NHL) protein, as a key component required for YrU1-mediated stripe rust resistance. TuNHL1 exhibits self-association and is capable of triggering hypersensitive cell death when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of TuNHL1 using the barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) system in the resistant T. urartu accession PI428309 significantly compromised resistance to the Pst isolate CY33, indicating that TuNHL1 is essential for YrU1-triggered immune responses.

The liver is the primary target of OTA, and oxidative stress alongside consequent inflammation, is considered the main contributor to OTA-induced liver damage. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a key constituent of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Astragalus membranaceus, exhibits diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunoregulatory, and organ-protective effects. However, whether AS-IV can ameliorate OTA-induced liver damage remains uncertain. In the current investigation, we investigated the effect of AS-IV on OTA-induced liver damage in chicks and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. The results revealed that AS-IV inhibited OTA-induced increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities. Additionally, AS-IV reversed the OTA-induced decrease in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activities, as well as the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content (P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that AS-IV is capable of mitigating mitochondrial damage and reducing the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the chicken liver cell line LMH induced by OTA. Moreover, AS-IV was discovered to reverse the OTA-induced decrease in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) expression, and the increase in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(Keap1) expression. Meanwhile, AS-IV also counteracted OTA-induced NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome expression.

    "combined_text": "Plant ZIP transporter: functional analysis on metal uptake, transport, and homeostasis.\n\nThe zinc-regulated transporters and iron-regulated transporter-like proteins (ZIP) represent a significant class of cation transport proteins in living organisms. They play a pivotal role in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of cations during metabolic processes and in the development of the organism. Therefore, it is imperative to characterize comprehensively ZIP transporters and their functional divergence among phylogenetically diverse plant species under specific metal stress conditions. This review focuses on recent advances in the molecular mechanisms of ZIP transporters governing metal uptake, transport, and homeostasis. ZIP transporters exhibit phylogenetically conserved yet tissue-divergent expression, reflecting spatiotemporal control of cation homeostasis. Some ZIP transporters, which primarily facilitate rhizospheric metal absorption and their subsequent loading into the xylem for transportation to the aboveground. In foliar issues, ZIP proteins coordinate symplasmic metal redistribution and vacuolar sequestration to maintain cellular ion homeostasis. Furthermore, ZIP transporters of the woody plants have a stronger ability to transport cadmium and zinc to the aboveground compared with herbaceous plants. The regulatory pathways governing ZIP transporters are also summarized, encompassing transcription factors, phytohormones et al. Finally, the application of ZIP transporters in soil phytoremediation and breeding strategies is also discussed to improve metal ion uptake in plants, enhance environmental remediation, and support biofortification efforts. Overall, ZIP transporters hold the potential to enhance Zn and Fe accumulation while mitigating Cd uptake in crops. Comprehensive research on these zinc-iron transport proteins can provide robust theoretical foundations and practical technical support for improving plant nutrition, enhancing stress resistance, and remediating environmental pollution.",

    "combined_text": "Deep phenotyping of patients with citrin deficiency in Singapore- single centre experience.\n\nCitrin deficiency (CD) is a pan-ethnic autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism due to-pathogenic variants in the SLC25A13 gene which results in disruptions of multiple metabolic pathways including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, the urea cycle, and tricarboxylic cycle.\n\nA retrospective observational study of CD patients managed according to standard clinical practice at a single centre in Singapore (KK Women's and Children's Hospital, KKH) was undertaken from August 2016-August 2024. We present the largest cohort of patients reported in Southeast Asia focusing on clinical, biochemical and imaging findings at diagnosis, and long-term outcomes/management (including drug therapy, food preferences/adherence, hospital admissions, growth, neurodevelopmental, biochemical, and imaging outcomes). We also explore the utility of newborn screening (NBS) as a means for early detection of CD.\n\nEighteen CD patients (9 males; 2 sibling pairs) majority of Chinese ethnicity (n = 16) with a median duration of follow up 5 years 5 months, participated in this study. Median age at first presentation and at diagnosis was 50 days and 82 days, respectively. Fourteen patients presented with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by CD (NICCD), 2 asymptomatic from sibling screens, and two from abnormalities on NBS (one presenting with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and the other with cholestasis and liver failure). Two patients had liver failure (one from NICCD group and another from NBS group). None required liver transplantation. All symptomatic patients had raised citrulline and threonine-serine ratios at presentation. None of the patients was prescribed any regular concomitant medications except for MCT oil. No genotype phenotype correlation was observed. At final assessment, all patients showed normalisation of liver parameter, galactose and plasma amino acids. Abnormalities in lipid profile in 9 patients (age 5-16 years) showed borderline high total cholesterol (median 5.4 mmol/L) and LDL (median 3.0 mmol/L) which was on the higher end of the normal range. Sixty-six percent of patients liver imaging findings were normal or showed stable changes. Food preferences (assessed in ≥1-year olds) did not reflect a clear bias towards high protein/fat diet. Adherence appeared to improve with a more prescriptive approach, it waned with age (more so in dietary aspects versus the use of MCT oil). Hospital admissions were few (median 1/patient) and unrelated to CD. Overall improvements were seen in weight, height and BMI for age z-scores, showing median weight/height/BMI for age z-scores to be -0.72, -0.83, 0.08, respectively. None had neurodevelopmental concerns.\n\nCD remains challenging to diagnose biochemically at all ages. Current NBS strategies require further refining to increase pick up rates of CD. Cascade screening utilising genetic testing is recommended due to the presence of phenotypic heterogeneity among patients with the same genotype. However, in the absence of available genetic testing, CD should be considered in all children presenting with prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the presence of elevated ALP, total galactose, with/without transaminitis and typical PAA profile. With our standard treatment for CD, we observed: (i) normalisation of biochemical parameters, (ii) normalisation/stabilisation of liver imaging findings, (iii) improvements in weight/height/BMI for age scores. Adoption of a prescriptive approach appeared to encourage treatment adherence.\n\nThis retrospective study examines 18 patients with citrin deficiency at KK Women's and Children's Hospital in Singapore, the largest cohort reported in Southeast Asia. The study assesses clinical, biochemical, imaging findings, and outcome measures. Results showed improvements in growth, biochemical normalisation, and stable liver imaging with standard treatment (dietary adjustments and MCT oil). While NBS detected some cases, there remains a need for better screening strategies. This study also demonstrated a lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, suggesting that cascade screening utilising genetic testing are crucial for early diagnosis.",

In this study, we present the first integrative systems-level approach to identify and validate a multi-target natural compound from 10 South Korean spices targeting this axis. Among 1053 compounds curated from the spices, 73 candidates were filtered using ADMET criteria to ensure central nervous system (CNS) compatibility. Target prediction analysis identified 399 genes associated with both AD and CVD, and subsequent topological network analysis prioritized five hub genes: STAT3, MAPK1, ESR1, SRC, and HSP90AA1. Artesin, a sesquiterpene lactone derived from ginger, showed the highest binding affinities (-8.0 to -8.3 kcal/mol) across all hub gene-encoded proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analyses indicated stable interactions with ERα, HSP90AA1, and SRC, while MAPK1 and STAT3 exhibited greater structural flexibility and moderate binding affinities, reflecting their dynamic roles in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Functional module clustering grouped these hub genes into domains associated with inflammation, oxidative balance, lipid metabolism, and hormonal response, providing a mechanistic basis for artesin's multi-target effects. Overall, our findings suggest that artesin modulates convergent pathological pathways along the brain-heart axis via coordinated regulation of immune, metabolic, and stress-response processes. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate these computational findings. This study highlights artesin as a promising integrative modulator of the brain-heart axis and underscores the utility of systems-level computational strategies in discovering bioactive compounds from natural products.",

Results showed that maternal low-protein diet did not effect offspring growth performance (final body weight, average daily gain, feed conversion ratio; P > 0.05). However, it reduced the initial body weight of all broiler offspring (P < 0.01). In males, maternal low-protein diet did not effect slaughter performance (P > 0.05); increased thymus index and breast shear force (P < 0.05); and reduced breast muscle fiber cross-sectional area and diameter (P < 0.01), and the jejunal crypt depth (P < 0.05).

High-load resistance training of the upper body is one way to achieve mechanical loading of the lumbar spine and the hip bones. In addition, maintaining good nutritional status with key nutrients for bone remodeling, that is, vitamin D and calcium, is important for bone accrual.\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effect of 24 weeks of high-load resistance training combined with nutritional optimization on lumbar spine BMD. Secondary objectives are to investigate the effects of the intervention on (1) bone and physical health parameters, such as bone turnover blood markers, nutritional status, body composition, and maximal muscular strength, as well as (2) exercise motivation and mental health.\n\nIn this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to include 60 wheelchair users with nonprogressive impairments. Participants were randomly allocated to 24 weeks of either (1) high-load resistance training and nutrition optimization or (2) nutrition optimization only, stratified by sex and sport activity status. The training program consisted of 3 weekly sessions comprising 6 exercises periodized in low-, moderate-, and high-load phases. The nutritional optimization aimed to ensure sufficient intake of protein, vitamin D, and calcium. BMD and body composition; maximal muscular strength; and nutritional, physical, and mental health status were assessed at baseline, midpoint, and postintervention visits. Furthermore, follow-up assessments of a subgroup were conducted at 6 to 18 months after the intervention. This protocol was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics South-East, Norway.\n\nRecruitment occurred between November 2022 and 2023. A total of 68 wheelchair users were screened for eligibility, of whom 45 (66%) were enrolled and allocated to one of the study groups (n=24, 53% training group; n=21, 47% control group).

Analysis of the data collected at the screening visit commenced in spring 2024, while analyses of data collected at the baseline and retest visits began in autumn 2024. Publication of the results of this study is expected by the end of 2025.\n\nThis protocol presents the first randomized controlled trial of a high-load resistance training intervention in wheelchair users, focusing on bone, physical, and mental health.

The reliable identification and characterization of cholesterol-interaction sites, which can help toward the development of novel allosteric drugs, is challenging, but different biophysical methods, such as structural biology and molecular dynamics simulations, can be combined toward this aim. We reviewed results for 14 receptors selected based on phylogenetic relationships, functional relevance, and their established significance as therapeutic targets. The precise mechanistic interpretation of the effect of cholesterol at a molecular level is generally ambiguous for many class A GPCRs. Additionally, the experimentally observed effect of cholesterol on the function of a receptor often varies, likely due to variations in experimental systems, including cell types, lipid environments, protein constructs, or methodological differences. To elucidate the role of cholesterol in GPCR function, a robust methodological framework is required─one that integrates diverse biophysical techniques with carefully controlled experimental conditions, particularly regarding membrane composition and cellular context. Additionally, combining insights from both in vitro and in vivo studies is crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of cholesterol's role in GPCR modulation.",

Its phosphorylation regulates downstream signaling events upon stimulation of receptors containing an immune tyrosine activation motif (ITAM), like glycoprotein VI (GPVI), or a hemITAM, including the C-type lectin-like receptor II-type (CLEC-2). This study focuses on the role of a specific phosphorylation site, Tyrosine 317, in the regulation of Syk function. Tyrosine 317 is located in the linker region of Syk that separates the amino-terminal, tandem pair of SH2 domains from the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. The amino acid sequence surrounding phosphotyrosine 317 binds to the matching recognition sequence in the tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB) domain of Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. To evaluate the function of this phosphorylation site, we generated mice expressing Syk(Y317F) using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Platelets from homozygous Syk(Y317F) mice showed enhancement of platelet signaling and physiological responses after stimulation with collagen-related peptide (CRP) and CLEC-2 crosslinking. This enhancement did not occur after stimulation with AYPGKF, a PAR4 agonist, or 2-MeSADP, a purinergic agonist. CRP- or CLEC-2 mAb-induced downstream signaling events, including phosphorylation of LAT and PLCɣ2, were enhanced in Syk(Y317F) platelets compared to platelets from wild-type (WT) littermates. Besides an increase in platelet responses in vitro, the time to occlusion in the FeCl3 injury model was decreased in Syk(Y317F) mice compared to WT littermates. However, there was no significant difference in the tail bleeding times. Taken together, these data reveal that Tyrosine 317 negatively regulates Syk signaling and functions in mouse platelets.",

Therefore, understanding the biology of this protein and developing therapeutic interventions targeting pathological processing of aSyn are a key area of focus for novel treatments to slow or stop PD. Reliable preclinical models are imperative for these efforts. To this end, we developed a novel model using CRISPR/Cas9 to humanize the regions surrounding the naturally occurring threonine 53 amino acid in the Sprague Dawley rat to generate a humanized A53T aSyn rat model (aSyn A53T KI). We also generated an Snca knockout (aSyn KO) line to pair with the humanized A53T aSyn rat line to confirm that phenotypes were not due to loss of endogenous rat aSyn protein. A systematic phenotyping study was performed on these lines, assessing PD-related pathology and phenotypes at multiple timepoints. The aSyn KO rat line was profiled at 6 and 12 months of age, revealing successful aSyn protein knockout. The aSyn A53T KI model was profiled at 4, 8, 12, and 18 months of age for motor and non-motor phenotypes, nigrostriatal degeneration, and brain pathology.

In an apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE)-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis, SerBut reduced systemic LDL-C, proinflammatory cytokines, and circulating neutrophils. SerBut enhanced inhibition of plaque progression and reduced monocyte accumulation in the aorta compared with sodium butyrate.

Pharmacological agents that similarly impair translation elongation and promote ribosome collisions mimicked the AR translation reduction observed with ADF.

The high genetic and antigenic variability of the CDV H protein and the specificity of its interaction with signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) and nectin-4 play a crucial role in determining the host specificity and tropism of the virus. It remains to be definitely established whether CDV may be localised in the urogenital tract or cause abortions in pregnant dogs. In this study, we investigated SLAM- and nectin-4-associated CDV infection of uterine tissue and adaptation of CDV to uterine tissue of dogs. For this purpose, 100 canine uterus samples were included in the study. CDV was detected by PCR in dogs without clinical signs, and molecular characterization of the virus was performed by bioinformatic analysis and comparison of partial amino acid sequences of the CDV H protein. In these uterine tissues infected with CDV, cellular SLAM and nectin-4 expression using histopathological, immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescence techniques. Sequence analysis showed that CDV strains belonging to the Asia-1 lineage are circulating in dogs in Türkiye and are responsible for uterine infections. Pathological analysis revealed increased SLAM and nectin-4 expression in CDV-infected uterine tissues compared to healthy uterine tissues. CDV was detected in 13 out of 100 uterine specimens tested, and increased expression of SLAM and nectin-4 was demonstrated for the first time in infected uterine tissues. Molecular and pathological analysis indicated that CDV may play a role in receptor-associated uterine infections. The data from this study will provide a basis for more extensive future research.",

    "combined_text": "[Principles of diet therapy for sarcopenic obesity: A review].\n\nNutrition and physical activity play a key role in the onset and progression of sarcopenic obesity (SO). Therefore, dietary interventions are essential in comprehensive programs to prevent and treat this condition. The classic approach to obesity diet therapy, which is to reduce the caloric value of the diet, is associated with a decrease in body weight due to both fat and fat-free components. In elderly patients with SO, a reduction in body weight impacts not only the muscle mass but also muscle function. A promising approach to diet therapy for this type of obesity is qualitative modification of the diet structure used for weight loss. The clinical role of specific components of diets, foods, and overall dietary patterns that are effective for CO treatment remains poorly understood. Sufficient intake of high-quality protein and branched-chain amino acids is known to stabilize and increase muscle mass, and recommended protein intakes in patients with SO of different ages continue to be discussed. It has been shown that in the elderly and senile age, the need for energy decreases; however, the need for protein increases. The role of ù-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, and polyphenols in the treatment of SO may be due to their anti-inflammatory effect, as well as, possibly, activation of mitochondrial functions and regulation of myogenesis processes. Developing and using specialized foods containing proteins, branched-chain amino acids, and other key nutrients can improve the effectiveness of SO therapy.

Extracted from various plant leaves, leaf proteins are high in essential amino acids and offer potential for multiple food applications. Their extraction also supports circular economy principles by converting agricultural by-products into valuable resources. Recent advances in extraction technologies, such as enzymatic hydrolysis, ultrasound-assisted extraction, and membrane filtration, have improved protein yield, purity, and functionality. These techniques aim to overcome traditional challenges, particularly removing chlorophyll and anti-nutritional factors that affect flavor, color, and overall consumer acceptance. However, despite notable progress, significant hurdles remain in scaling up extraction for commercial use. Low protein yields, high processing costs, and the persistence of undesirable sensory attributes, such as green color and earthy flavors, limit wider adoption. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in leaf protein extraction, highlights key technological and commercial barriers, and explores potential food applications. Synthesizing current research identifies opportunities for innovation to improve extraction efficiency, enhance product quality, and promote the use of leaf proteins in sustainable food systems. Future developments could significantly contribute to addressing global protein demands sustainably.",

The present study aimed to comparatively evaluate non-gluten-free (non-GF) and gluten-free (GF) products in terms of nutritional quality and cost in Turkey. Data on nutritional content and cost were collected from labels of 456 packaged GF and non-GF food products available in Turkey. Products were categorized into nine food groups, and the Health Star Rating (HSR) system was used to assess nutritional quality.\n\nGluten-free breads, pastas, flours, biscuits, cookies and snacks had significantly lower protein content (P < 0.05). Although the HSR star count of non-GF foods was higher in the breads and flours group, the HSR star count of GF foods was higher in the biscuits and cookies, oats and candies group (P < 0.05). Statistically significant results were obtained in all food groups except oats and the unit cost of non-GF foods was lower than GF foods (P < 0.05). Although an increase in number of HSR stars was observed with decrease in energy, carbohydrate, total sugar, fat, saturated fat, sodium and cost, an increase in number of HSR stars was observed with an increase in protein and fiber (P < 0.05).\n\nThe nutritional value of GF products, particularly commercially available flours, is not superior to that of non-GF products, whereas GF foods are generally more than twice as expensive.

They are manufactured using successive additions of dry ingredients and oils to skim bovine milk, blending, pasteurization, homogenization, concentration by vacuum evaporation and spray-drying. However, successive heat loads are detrimental to the proteins' nutritional quality of the final product.

Recent discoveries have determined that many benefits of a low protein diet are the result of reduced consumption of the three branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Intriguingly, each BCAA has distinct physiological and molecular effects, with restriction of isoleucine alone being sufficient to improve metabolic health and extend the lifespan of mice. While restriction of protein or all three BCAAs improves cognition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the impact of restricting each individual BCAA on the progression and development of AD is unknown. Here, we investigate the effect of restricting each individual BCAA on metabolic health, AD pathology, molecular signaling, and cognition in the 3xTg mouse model. We find that restriction of isoleucine and valine, but not leucine, promotes metabolic health. Restriction of each BCAA had distinct effects on AD pathology and molecular signaling, with transcriptomic analysis of the brain revealing both distinct and shared, and highly sex-specific, molecular impacts of restricting each BCAA. Restricting any of the three BCAAs improved short-term memory in males, with isoleucine restriction having the strongest effect, while restricting valine had the greatest cognitive benefits in females. We identify a set of significantly altered pathways strongly associated with reduced AD pathology and improved cognitive performance in males. Our findings suggest that restricting any of the BCAAs, particularly isoleucine or valine, may form the basis of a novel sex-specific approach to prevent or delay the progression of AD.",

Emerging evidence suggests the UBR-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (UBR1-7) are involved in the positive regulation of skeletal muscle mass. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of UBR-box E3 ubiquitin ligases under enhanced protein synthesis and skeletal muscle growth conditions. Cohorts of adult male mice were electroporated with constitutively active Akt (Akt-CA) or UBR5 RNAi constructs with a rapamycin diet intervention for 7 and 30 days, respectively. In addition, the UBR-box family was studied during the regrowth phase post nerve crush induced inactivity. Skeletal muscle growth with Akt-CA or regrowth following inactivity increased protein abundance of UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, UBR5 and UBR7. This occurred with corresponding increases in Akt-mTORC1/S6K and MAPK/p90RSK signaling and protein synthesis. The increases in UBR-box E3s, ubiquitination, and proteasomal activity occurred independently of mTORC1 activity and were associated with increases in markers related to autophagy, ER-stress, and protein quality control pathways. Finally, while UBR5 knockdown (KD) evokes atrophy, it occurs together with hyperactivation of mTORC1 and protein synthesis. In UBR5 KD muscles, we identified an increase in protein abundance for UBR2, UBR4 and UBR7, which may highlight a compensatory response to maintain proteome integrity. Future studies will seek to understand the role of UBR-box E3s towards protein quality control in skeletal muscle plasticity.\n\nNovel UBR-box E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsive to heightened protein synthesis and alterations in skeletal muscle mass and fiber size, in order to maintain proteome integrity.",

Commercial recoveries of these citrus peel flavonoids typically involve initial water extractions, and in certain cases the removal of pectin by ion-exchange resins. A consistent feature of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatograms of such aqueous peel extracts is significantly elevated broad baselines. These baselines suggest the occurrence of wide populations of possibly similar chemical entities. In this study, isolations of these materials by either ultrafiltration or LH20 column chromatography led to the recoveries of fractions, termed 'baseline fractions' particularly enriched in the peel materials responsible for these elevated baselines. The goal of this study was to isolate the material responsible for these elevated baselines and to conduct an initial chemical characterization and possible identification of this portion of citrus peel water extracts.\n\nThe water-soluble component of these baseline fractions was determined to be protein as determined by its Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The remaining major components of these baseline fractions were freely soluble in methanol, and the FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of these components were indicative of the plant polymer, suberin. Size exclusion chromatography showed this material to largely occur between 10 and 60 kDa as would be expected for this plant polymer.\n\nIt is proposed in this study that suberin is responsible for the broad elevated HPLC baselines of citrus extracts.

The name of these lipids originates from their (at the time) enigmatic nature and lack of knowledge about their cellular function, which was compared to the creature sphinx in Greek mythology. Today we know that SLs play an important role in a plethora of physiological and cellular processes, including tissue development, growth regulation, apoptosis, adhesion, cell migration, cell senescence, receptor signaling, and hormonal effects and are associated with multiple pathological processes in many different disease contexts. In addition to roles for specific SLs in developmental processes, their critical role in causing and preventing metabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes during adulthood, has been uncovered through targeted genetic manipulation, lipidomics, and advanced biochemical analyses such as lipid-protein interactomics.

This study aimed to investigate whether aerobic exercise can ameliorate PVAT-induced vascular dysfunction in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet.\n\nMale C57BL/6J mice were fed either a chow or a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of aerobic treadmill training or sedentary control. Body weight, PVAT morphology, and levels of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1), adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), and phosphorylation of endothelial signaling proteins (Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase [AMPK], and endothelial nitric oxide synthase [eNOS]) were evaluated in the thoracic aorta and PVAT. Endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) was assessed using acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in aortic rings with or without PVAT.\n\nHigh-fat diet-induced obesity led to increased adipocyte size in PVAT, while it also impaired vascular relaxation, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and reduced phosphorylation of Akt, AMPK, and eNOS in both PVAT and the aorta. Aerobic exercise training significantly reduced PVAT adipocyte size, restored EDR, suppressed inflammatory cytokine levels, increased adiponectin expression, and promoted phosphorylation of vascular signaling molecules in both PVAT and the aorta.\n\nAerobic exercise training restores PVAT homeostasis and endothelial function in obese mice by modulating inflammation, adipokines, and vascular signaling. These findings suggest aerobic exercise as a nonpharmacological approach to improve vascular function in obesity by targeting PVAT dysfunction.",

Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 3 (ASB3) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates diverse disease processes; however, the direct substrates of ASB3 in lipid metabolism and its role in MASLD remain unexplored.\n\nWe generated ASB3 knockout mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce MASLD. Oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) were used to assess lipid metabolism. LC‒MS/MS and IP were used to verify the ASB3 target protein. Correlation analysis was conducted on the cohort of MASLD patients versus the control group.\n\nLoss of the ASB3 E3 ubiquitin ligase in hepatocytes strengthens mitochondrial FAO, thereby influencing energy consumption to decrease triglyceride storage and lipid accumulation. Quantitative lysine ubiquitination proteomics revealed that ASB3 directly mediated the ubiquitin levels at two sites (K180 and K639) in carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A), a rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, to induce CPT1A degradation. Moreover, both constitutive and hepatocyte-specific ASB3 knockout enhance FAO and delay lipid accumulation, liver steatosis, and MASLD progression in a CPT1A-dependent manner. Hepatic ASB3 deficiency also delays fibrosis in MASLD. Analysis of public databases and liver tissue samples from MASLD patients revealed that ASB3 was highly expressed in MASLD patients and was negatively correlated with CPT1A.\n\nOur study reveals the key roles of ASB3 in the development of MASLD and suggests a novel therapeutic potential for MASLD.",

Notably, the protective effects of ELE on MASH were abolished in the absence of PPARα.\n\nOur studies reveal that ELE is a novel stabiliser of PPARα, effectively inhibiting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation in MASH.

Although this cancer is relatively rare, it causes significant mortality. Among environmental risk factors, frequent exposure to ionizing radiation has significantly increased the risk of glioma. Special attention has been paid to diet and dietary factors in recent decades. Although the role of diet in some cancers has been confirmed in previous studies, the link between dietary intake, the immune system, and glioma is still questionable. In the current review, a higher dietary intake of vitamin C, folate, vitamin A, phytochemicals, and calcium might be associated with immune system activation and reduced risk of glioma. In addition, adherence to a high-carbohydrate diet is associated with a high risk of glioma. Despite the evidence, limited data are available for some important fatty acids, B vitamins, protein, vitamins D, E, K, magnesium, copper, zinc, iron, and selenium, and some healthy dietary patterns regarding glioma risk. In terms of clinical outcomes, the ketogenic diet might play a role in the management of glioma and might be used as an adjunctive therapy in these patients. Although observational studies have shown that a higher dietary intake of folate, vitamin C, calcium, and vitamin A was associated with the activation of the immune system and reduced risk of glioma, the complex interactions between diet, immune system, and glioma on the clinical outcomes of patients with glioma have not been investigated.

In C. mollissima, flowering is fundamental for nut yield. The MADS-box gene APETALA 1 (AP1) plays essential roles in floral initiation and floral organ development in many plants. However, the function of the AP1 gene CmAP1 in C. mollissima is still unclear. Here, we cloned the coding sequence (CDS) and promoter of CmAP1 and analyzed the function of this gene.\n\nThe CDS of CmAP1 is 741 bp and encodes a 246-amino acid protein. Subcellular analysis revealed that CmAP1 localizes to the nucleus. GUS driven by the CmAP1 promoter was expressed in seedlings and in leaf margins, petals, and carpels of transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). RNA in situ hybridization indicated that CmAP1 was mainly expressed in the inflorescence meristem, floral primordia, sepal primordia, petal primordia, stamen primordia, and carpel primordia during the early stage of flower development. An auxin response element (TGA element), jasmonic acid response element (TGACG motif), and WRKY binding site (W-box element) were identified in the CmAP1 promoter. Heterologous expression of CmAP1 in wild-type and ap1-11 Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering. Notably, the expression of CmAP1 rescued the loss of the petal whorl in the ap1-11 mutant. AtAP1, AtSEP1, AtSEP2, AtSEP3, and AtSEP4 were upregulated in CmAP1-expressing Arabidopsis plants.\n\nThese findings suggest that CmAP1 promotes flowering and plays a key role in petal development. Our findings help reveal the regulatory mechanism of flowering and flower development in C. mollissima, providing a practical basis for increasing yield in Chinese chestnut.",

There is currently no efficacious treatment for CTD, while current management for GAMT requires lifelong treatment with a protein restricted diet and intake of high amounts of oral supplements. Efforts to conduct clinical trials on potential treatments for these disorders are made more difficult by the lack of clinical and patient-derived meaningful outcomes. A core outcome set (COS) can facilitate consistent use of outcomes in studies. The current effort included patient and caregiver perspectives into the outcome selection of a COS for CTD and GAMT.\n\nWe partnered with caregivers and health professionals to establish the first COS for CTD and GAMT. The COS developed includes seven outcomes (\"Adaptive Functioning\", \"Cognitive Functioning\", \"Emotional Dysregulation\", \"MRS Brain Creatine\", \"Seizure/Convulsions\", \"Expressive Communication\", and \"Fine Motor Functions\") for both CTD and GAMT, and an additional outcome for GAMT (\"Serum/Plasma Guanidinoacetate\") that are important to stakeholders and consequently should be considered for measurement in every clinical trial. Caregivers were valued partners throughout the COS development process, which increased community engagement and facilitated caregiver empowerment.\n\nDevelopment of this COS illustrates a patient-centered approach for clinical trial readiness for CTD and GAMT that if utilized will make clinical trial results comparable, minimize bias in clinical trial outcome selection, and promote efficient use of resources.",

If melatonin at \"physiological\" doses achievable through the intake of foods and beverages affects the development of liver diseases, it has not yet been clarified; therefore, we assessed whether supplementing \"dietary doses\" of melatonin affects the development of ALD in mice. Female 6-8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were either pair-fed a liquid alcohol-enriched Lieber DeCarli diet or a control diet ± melatonin (50 ng/kg BW/day) for 6 weeks. Markers of liver damage and intestinal barrier function were assessed. Moreover, the effects of melatonin on intestinal barrier function were assessed in an ex vivo model. Supplementing melatonin significantly attenuated the development of ALD being related to lower interleukin-6 protein, NOx, and 4-hydroxynonenal protein adduct levels in liver tissue. Impairments of intestinal barrier function in small intestine in ethanol-fed mice were significantly attenuated in ethanol-fed mice treated with melatonin being associated with lower NOx and higher phosphorylation levels of AMPK. In summary, our results suggest that an oral supplementation of \"dietary\" doses of melatonin may dampen the development of ALD in mice. KEY MESSAGES: Supplementation of \"dietary\" doses of melatonin dampens the development of ALD. Melatonin attenuates alcohol-induced small intestinal barrier dysfunction.

Furthermore, we provide evidence that the selectivity for proline-rich target glycosylation sites that differentiates MtPMT from its eukaryotic homologues, relies on a WW-like domain, which preferentially interacts with proline-rich acceptor substrate analogues. This first identification of a functional WW-like domain in a prokaryotic protein raises questions about its potential evolutionary linkage with eukaryotic WW modules and provides new insights into PMT's acceptor-substrate recognition mechanism paving the way for the development selective inhibitors of MtPMT with potential therapeutic application against tuberculosis.",

While significant efforts have been made to develop algorithms that assist PwT1D in managing blood glucose more effectively, access to automated insulin delivery (AID) systems remains highly variable across the world. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets necessary for developing algorithms to support scenarios where AID systems revert to manual mode. This study addresses this gap by providing a detailed, multimodal dataset encompassing five key aspects: blood glucose levels; basal and bolus insulin dosages; nutritional intake (carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fibre content); physical activity (step count, active calories, distance covered, MET, and intensity level); and sleep patterns. The dataset includes longitudinal (3-month) real-world data collected from 17 PwT1D participants. By making this resource available, the study aims to advance algorithm development and improve diabetes management, particularly in settings where AID technology is less accessible.",

Notably, dysmyelination in the corpus callosum serves as a prominent element connecting GDM and autism in the white matter lesions.\n\nThe cumulative effects of GDM and prenatal VPA on both autistic behavior and dysmyelination in progeny have been investigated in this study.\n\nIn vivo, female mice exhibiting leptin receptor deficiencies and maintained on a high-fat diet were utilized to create GDM models, to which prenatal VPA was administered. In vitro, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were treated with VPA in the high-fat and high-glucose culture.\n\nThe offspring subjected to both GDM and prenatal VPA demonstrated comparable declines in social interaction, myelination, and OPC maturation, akin to those exclusively exposed to VPA. Remarkably, the application of clemastine facilitated remyelination, ameliorated autistic behaviors, and promoted the progression of OPCs. Furthermore, the compromised myelination and OPC maturation instigated by the combination of GDM and prenatal VPA were found to be less severe compared to those precipitated by VPA alone. This differential impact can be attributed to the opposing influences of GDM and VPA on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor activation in OPCs, extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) phosphorylation in OPCs, and the modulation of histone deacetylase 3 and dual specificity phosphatase 5 expression.\n\nwe delineate the antagonistic effects of GDM and prenatal VPA on ERK phosphorylation in fetal OPCs, consequently altering their proliferation and differentiation, thereby culminating in milder dysmyelination and autistic behaviors.",

This study aims to identify novel targets for immunotherapy in ESCC.\n\nESCC cell lines and mouse models were used to identify the tumor-promoting function of pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) and evaluate the effect of blockade of CD24.

Deficiency of PPDPF inhibited the development of ESCC in mice. Mechanistically, PPDPF interfered with the c-Myc-GSK3β interaction and enhanced the protein stability of c-Myc, which increased the expression of CD24 and therefore promoted immune escape from macrophage phagocytosis.

The precise pathophysiological mechanisms triggering obesity-related kidney impairment remain elusive, especially after dietary correction. Male C57BL6/J mice (n = 15) were divided in: control group (CTR) fed with standard chow; a group fed with HFD for 200 days (28-29 weeks); and a group fed with HFD for 60 days (8-9 weeks) and then with standard chow (HFDt)(∼21 weeks). Biometric data and whole-body metabolism were assessed. Expression of genes associated with mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial complexes and antioxidant defenses were analyzed. Kidney homogenates enriched in mitochondria were prepared and characterized by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Kidney tissue of mice fed HFD exhibited reduced PGC-1α expression, an imbalance between fusion (increased MFN1 and decreased OPA1) and fission (decreased FIS1 and DRP1) processes. The activity of mitochondrial complex I (CI) was increased, while activity of complex II (CII) was decreased in the kidney after HFD and HFDt. Antioxidant defense Manganese Superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was decreased in the kidney of HFD, while Glutathione reductase (GR) increased, with both activities being restored upon dietary reversion. Proteomic analysis showed alterations in proteins associated with glutathione and glycine metabolism, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and peroxisomal function. HFD negatively impacted kidney glutathione related proteins (Gsta3 and Gsr); however dietary correction reverted this condition. Acsm3 protein was downregulated in kidney after HFD and upregulated after dietary correction. Some machinery is shared by mitochondria and peroxisomes, with their network being crucial particularly under stress conditions. A HFD impaired kidney FAO in peroxisomes, as evidenced by downregulation of Pecr after HFD and HFDt. Dietary correction after early-obesity mitigates the systemic metabolic dysfunction and can attenuate mitochondria dysfunction but is unable to completely restore mitochondria dynamics and bioenergetics. The results highlight the integrity of mitochondrial network as a main point for targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing the progression of kidney disease.",

It is particularly effective for symptoms like excessive phlegm and chest tightness. However, the specific active components of JWSZJQF and their molecular mechanisms in addressing mucus hypersecretion in COPD remain unclear, requiring further investigation and validation.\n\nThis study aims to identify the potential targets and signaling pathways of JWSZJQF in treating COPD-associated mucus hypersecretion using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS/MS, network pharmacology, and in vitro experimental verification.\n\nAll plant names were verified through WorldFloraOnline (www.worldFloraonline.org) and MPNs (http://mpns.kew.org). First, the effective components of JWSZJQF were identified and analyzed using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS/MS, supplemented by data from TCMSP. Network pharmacology analysis was used to determine the potential targets and pathways of JWSZJQF in COPD treatment. A mucus hypersecretion cell model was created using IL-17 cytokine, and the effectiveness of JWSZJQF in reducing mucus hypersecretion was assessed through immunofluorescence assay, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Lastly, a prospective study was conducted to collect data from 30 inpatients with AECOPD between September 2023 and July 2024. Serum samples before and after treatment were analyzed to validate the findings.\n\nA total of 864 active components were identified, with 79 potential COPD therapeutic targets confirmed based on the top 30 active components, including TNF, IL-6, and AKT1. The involved KEGG pathways included the IL-17 and NF-κB signaling pathways. In vitro experiments showed that JWSZJQF inhibited mucin (MUC5AC) secretion at both mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, JWSZJQF modulated i-κBα and p65 expression in the NF-κB pathway. Compared to the control group, patients treated with JWSZJQF exhibited lower levels of IL-17 and MUC5AC in their serum.\n\nThis study preliminarily explored the mechanisms of JWSZJQF in treating COPD-associated mucus hypersecretion through UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS/MS, network pharmacology, in vitro experiments, and clinical observation.

Despite its impact, computational studies on WSSV prophylaxis remain limited. This study investigates the potential of acyclovir (ACY) analogs in controlling WSSV using molecular docking/dynamics simulations and ecotoxicological studies. Among the compounds tested, GCV and TFV exhibited favorable energetic and statistical properties compared to ACY. This suggests that polar groups are crucial for interactions with key amino acid residues (Gln138, Met139, Asn154, and Ser156) of the VP28 protein, which is essential for binding specificity. Toxicity assessments showed that ACY and its analogs have low acute toxicity in aquatic species, including fish, D. magna, and G. algae. Notably, CDY and TFV demonstrated latency effects in D. magna and fish. Chronic toxicity predictions indicated that GCV showed no toxicity in ECOSAR models. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the GCV/VP28 complex was the most stable, with the greatest potential for protein inhibition, as evidenced by significant hydrogen bond occupancy and binding free energy. These findings highlight the promising potential of GCV as a candidate for WSSV inhibition, providing valuable insights for future antiviral development to mitigate WSSV's economic and social impacts in aquaculture.",

Complete structural detail facilitates the determination of a peptide's biological roles and meets the increasingly stringent demands for peptide-based therapeutics. Here, a comprehensive untargeted analytical workflow predicts possible peptide isomers from peptidomics data and then localizes the isomerized residues by using collision-induced dissociation-trapped ion mobility spectrometry (CID-TIMS) and protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) activity. The approach allows for the discovery and characterization of isomerized isoaspartate (isoAsp) residues and D-amino acids within the peptide. Potential isomeric peptide candidates are first identified from peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) obtained after a database search by applying a defined retention-time window and comparing the differential ion-mobility values of precursor ions corresponding to nominally identical peptides. CID-TIMS is then utilized to locate the isomerized amino acid(s) within the predicted isomers by comparing the mobilities of fragment ions detected at those retention times. Finally, PIMT is used to label isoAsp residues for confirmation. This integrated workflow enabled the localization of isoAsp residues in eight peptides from the rat hypothalamus. These peptides are from six prohormones, including proenkephalin, promelanin-concentrating hormone, secretogranin II, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and prosomatostatin.

The high mutation rates of viral genome pose serious challenges to the prevention and control of IB. Based on our previous studies on IBV isolates in southern China during 2009-2017, we continued to carry out the genetic evolution analyses of S1 gene from IBV isolates during 2018-2023. Furthermore, we investigated the temporal and geographical origin of 245 IBV strains from southern China during 1985-2023, and reconstructed their transmission dynamics. Our findings revealed that GI-19 (LX4-type) was still the most dominant genotype, with the coexistence of multiple genotypes. Notably, the GI-19 strains were further classified into three subgroups, one of which was a new GI-19 subtype with nucleotide sequence similarities less than 90 % compared to the vaccine strain QXL87, along with five and eight consecutive amino acid substitutions, respectively. GI-28 (LDT3-A-type) strains re-emerged in 2019 and remained predominant thereafter. In addition, there was an increasing isolation rate of GI-7 (Taiwan-I-type). The purification pressure was detected in the S1 protein IBV isolates during 2018-2023, but eight positive selection sites with high entropy values were identified. Five isolates were confirmed to be recombinants, and GI-22 strains involved in all five recombinants as major or minor parents. The estimated times for the most recent common ancestors based on the S1 gene was the years of 1905. Bayesian skyline analysis indicated a rapid increase in genetic diversity of the S1 gene in IBV strains since late 2015. Bayesian geographical analysis demonstrated that the southern China IBVs originated from Nanning and identified four principal transmission pathways. In conclusion, our findings revealed the emergence of a new GI-19 subtype of IBV, the re-emergence of GI-28, and multiple transmission routes in southern China during 2018-2023, underscoring the importance of real-time and continuous surveillance of circulating strains and the urgency of developing safe, effective, and broad-spectrum new vaccines against emerging and re-emerging IBVs.",

This study identified Pichia kudriavzevii M420 as the primary microorganism responsible for pellicle formation in fermented chili peppers, which significantly reduced the levels of organic acids, free amino acids, and aroma compounds. Consequently, this altered the sensory profile of pickles by diminishing sourness and sweetness, increasing bitterness, and introducing a wine-like flavor along with other undesirable odors, thereby compromising overall quality. Co-culturing with Pediococcus ethanolidurans M1117 effectively inhibited pellicle formation through microbial interactions with P. kudriavzevii M420. Transcriptome analysis revealed substantial downregulation of genes in P. kudriavzevii M420, particularly those involved in energy metabolism, genetic information processing, and cellular functions. Notably, inhibition of protein synthesis was identified as a crucial mechanism in preventing pellicle formation. These findings provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pellicle formation and highlight the potential of P. ethanolidurans M1117 as an innovative biocontrol strategy to enhance the quality and safety of fermented chili peppers.",

While ozonated water stress causes severe leaf damage in plants, little is known about its effects on cucumber leaves and underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the effects of spraying ozonated water on cucumber seedlings by integrating physiological phenotypes with molecular mechanisms. The results showed that spraying ozonated water led to the disorder of leaf anatomical structure, damage of the photosynthetic system, and the chlorophyll content decreased significantly. Significant changes in oxidative damage indicators, osmotic adjustment substances accumulated, and the antioxidant system were damaged. Transcriptome analysis indicated that spraying ozonated water strongly regulated the expression of stress defense genes. GO and KEGG analyses showed that DEGs were primarily enriched in pathways related to plant antioxidant responses. In addition, in the WGCNA analysis, multiple transcription factors and protein kinases were identified. Metabolomics studies were also conducted, and KEGG enrichment analysis mainly enriched in glutathione metabolism and related amino acid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis indicated that spraying ozonated water activated and increased genes and metabolites related to oxidative stress in cucumbers to resist the damage caused by ozonated water stress. Our study systematically revealed how cucumber seedlings adapt to ozonated water stress through physiological and molecular mechanisms, providing a scientific basis for optimizing its agricultural application.",

Cases were aged 18-64 years with an untreated psychotic disorder diagnosed according to ICD 10 criteria. Control participants were matched for age, sex, and neighbourhood. Physical health measurements were acquired using the WHO STEPwise approach to non-communicable disease risk factors surveillance instrument (WHO STEPS). We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) using unconditional logistic regression.\n\nWe included 225, 209, and 212 case-control pairs, respectively in Kancheepuram (India), Ibadan (Nigeria), and Northern Trinidad. Among cases, we found marked variations in health behaviours and physical health indicators across settings. In case-control comparisons within settings, cases were more likely to report poor diet (aORs of 1.31 [Trinidad] to 3.70 [Ibadan]), current smoking (aORs of 2.21 [Kancheepuram] to 3.35 [Trinidad]), and physical inactivity (aORs of 0.23 [Ibadan] to 0.62 [Kancheepuram]). However, we found no strong evidence that indicators of cardiometabolic comorbidity were consistently more common among cases compared with controls (i.e.,cases across sites were less likely than controls to have high blood pressure (aORs of 0.65 [Ibadan] to 0.76 [Trinidad]) and to be overweight (aORs of 0.70 [Kancheepuram] and 0.85 [Trinidad]), but were more likely than controls to have diabetes (aOR 1.94) and raised C-reactive protein levels (aOR 2.31) in Ibadan.

However, the role and specific mechanism of Ses in PFOS-induced liver inflammation remain largely unclear.\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotection and potential mechanism of Ses against PFOS-induced inflammation.\n\nWild-type (WT), Mincle knockout (Ko-mincle), and Hepatocyte-specific knockout Foxo1 (Hko-Foxo1) mice were intragastrically administered Ses and/or PFOS (10 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. In vitro, HepG2 cells were pretreated with Ses for 1 h, then exposed to PFOS for 24 h to establish a cell injury model.\n\nWe revealed that Ses markedly alleviated PFOS-induced liver injury and inflammation, as evidenced by noticeable histopathological improvements, increased cell activity, and alterations in serum liver enzyme and inflammatory factor levels. Moreover, Ses pretreatment reduced the expression of Mincle and the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, SYK and p65, in macrophages. The reducing effect of Ses on liver inflammation in wild-type mice is significantly better than that in Mincle knockout mice. We also found that Ses decreased the expression of spliceosome-associated protein 130 (SAP130) and Foxo1. Further experiments revealed that SAP130 may serve as a mediator between hepatocytes and macrophages. Hepatocyte-specific knockout Foxo1 reduced the release of SAP130 from hepatocytes and inhibited Mincle/Syk signaling activation in macrophages.\n\nThis study demonstrates that Ses protects against PFOS-induced liver inflammation in mice by modulating crosstalk between hepatocytes and macrophages.

While these supplements offer essential nutrients, they may also contain potentially toxic elements (PTEs) that pose health risks. This study assessed the metal content of 56 plant-based PS samples from European sources using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Dietary exposure to these elements was evaluated across three consumption scenarios, considering established reference intake values (AI/TDI/TWI/UL) and the Margin of Exposure (MOE) for lead (Pb). The analysis identified plant-based PS as significant sources of essential elements, including sodium (9101.66 mg/kg), potassium (5784.91 mg/kg), calcium (2201.45 mg/kg), molybdenum (1.63 mg/kg), manganese (25.14 mg/kg), copper (11.59 mg/kg), iron (132.58 mg/kg), zinc (62.56 mg/kg), chromium (0.45 mg/kg), and cobalt (0.11 mg/kg). However, these products also contained PTEs such as lead (0.07 mg/kg), cadmium (0.09 mg/kg), aluminum (18.39 mg/kg), nickel (1.19 mg/kg), strontium (5.67 mg/kg), barium (1.86 mg/kg), boron (4.59 mg/kg), and vanadium (0.05 mg/kg). At the recommended consumption level of 30 g/day, exposure to both essential and PTEs did not exceed reference intake limits. However, this dose accounted for 75 % of the Adequate Intake (AI) for molybdenum. Excessive consumption (100 g/day) raised concerns about exceeding the AI for copper (105.40 %) and magnesium (105.90 %) in women, as well as molybdenum (250.16 %) and iron (120.53 %) for men and postmenopausal women.

Life Cycle Assessment was conducted using 1 kg of live weight and 1 kg of ready-to-cook carcass as functional units. Ross 308 exhibited the highest final weight, daily weight gain, and feed conversion ratio, followed by crosses and local breeds. The LI diet resulted in reduced final weight (-13 %) and increased feed conversion ratio (+8 %) compared to ST diet, with commercial hybrids showed the greatest reduction in performance. The LI diet also reduced digestibility coefficients for dry matter, crude protein, and gross energy. Feed production was the dominant contributor to environmental impacts. Genotype influenced all impact categories, with Ross 308 showing the lowest values, while BP × SA and BP exhibited the highest ones. The LI diet reduced global warming potential with land use change (-46 %) but increased land occupation (+22 %) and water use (+26 %).

In contrast to the vast majority of their living relatives, members of the lizard families Chamaeleonidae and Agamidae have dispensed with lifelong tooth replacement, instead developing acrodont dentition that fuses to the jawbone to be used for the lifetime of the animal. Though, the loss of tooth replacement has not come without a cost. In order to mitigate the consequences that come with tooth replacement loss, mammals and acrodont lizards have evolved adaptations that strengthen enamel structure and minimize wear and tear experienced during the life of the animal. While these physical adaptations are well documented, the effect that loss of tooth replacement has had on the molecular components of teeth has not received significant attention. Here, we analyze the coding and amino acid sequences of six tooth proteins (AMBN, AMEL, AMTN, ACP4, ENAM, and MMP20) from acrodont lizards, pleurodont lizards that replace teeth, and mammals. We show that the reduction of tooth generations has disproportionately affected the evolutionary trajectory of proteins associated with enamel structure, with a particularly magnified effect on the evolution of AMEL.",

Male ICR mice were randomly assigned to the control (CG), model (MG), positive (25 mg/kg/day cyclophosphamide; PG), low-level EPA (LG, 100 mg/kg/day), and high-level EPA (HG, 300 mg/kg/day) groups. Various biochemical indicators were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Western blot was utilized to assess tumor apoptosis-related caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bcl-2-associated X, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and chemometric approaches were applied to determine serum metabolomics. EPA substantially impacted tumor growth in vivo without causing adverse reactions, indicating liver and kidney protection. EPA significantly increased the levels of glutamine, leucine, histidine, citrulline, creatine, prostaglandin A2, and prostaglandin D2 while decreasing levels of arachidonic acid, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, thromboxane B2, and pyruvate. These changes reflected a reduction in protein digestion and absorption, alterations in γ-aminobutyric acid metabolism, and shifts in amino acid metabolism, particularly affecting arachidonic acid, arginine, and proline. EPA exerted significant anticancer effects in mice mainly by reducing the compensatory energy supply from branched-chain amino acids, regulating amino acid metabolism, inhibiting negative nitrogen balance, enhancing immune responses, inhibiting inflammatory mediators, and promoting tumor cell apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment.",

Simple biomarkers to predict residual disease burden and prognosis are clinically valuable. The hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score reflects inflammation and nutritional status. This study evaluated the association of the HALP score with the residual Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score (rSS) and 12-month major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in T2DM patients with NSTEMI.\n\nThis retrospective study included 210 diabetic patients. Participants were stratified into three groups based on rSS (0, 1-8, > 8). HALP scores were calculated from admission laboratory values, and outcomes were followed for 12 months. Associations between HALP and rSS were assessed using Spearman correlation and multivariable regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a HALP cut-off value for predicting high rSS. The prognostic value for MACE was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis.\n\nHALP scores were significantly lower in patients with rSS > 8 (P < 0.001) and were negatively associated with rSS (β = -0.344, P < 0.001). The optimal HALP score cut-off for predicting rSS > 8 was 2.96, with 78% sensitivity and 77% specificity. Patients with HALP ≤ 2.96 had a higher prevalence of rSS > 8 (43.7% vs. 6.5%) and experienced more MACE over 12 months (29.6% vs. 13.7%, P = 0.005). In Cox analysis, a low HALP score (≤ 2.96) was an independent predictor of MACE, along with age and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (hazard ratio = 1.916, P = 0.045).\n\nLower HALP scores are associated with higher residual disease burden and worse outcomes.

Results showed that quinoa protein, particularly QJP1, was found to be rich in lysine and, compared with oat protein isolates, exhibited potent antioxidant properties, making it an ideal choice for vegetarians, vegans, and the elderly who require plant-based sources of essential amino acids and antioxidants. On the other hand, oat proteins, especially OPP4, showed a higher digestibility rate and a variety of differentially expressed proteins with potential health benefits, suggesting they may be particularly beneficial for consumers seeking rapid nutrient absorption, such as athletes. The study also highlighted the presence of common proteins within different quinoa and oat cultivars, indicating a high degree of similarity in their protein compositions.

This scoping review aimed to summarize the available literature on the association between protein intake and sarcopenia-related outcomes among Korean older adults and identify current research trends and gaps in this field. The review followed the 5-step methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley for scoping reviews and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist to ensure a comprehensive search strategy. Protein intake was assessed using various methods, including grams per day, grams per kilogram of body weight per day, and intake quartiles. Sarcopenia-related outcomes were categorized into 3 domains as follows: muscle mass, strength, and physical performance. Although most intervention studies demonstrated improvements in muscle mass following protein supplementation, findings on muscle strength and physical function were inconsistent. Cross-sectional studies generally reported better sarcopenia-related outcomes with higher protein intake, particularly when the intake was expressed relative to body weight or analyzed according to quartiles. However, heterogeneity in protein intake assessments and variations in sarcopenia definitions could have contributed to the inconsistent findings across studies. This review highlights the need for applying standardized approaches for protein intake measurement and sarcopenia diagnosis. Future studies should consider the quantity, quality, and timing of protein intake while also focusing on the implementation of integrated, multidisciplinary intervention strategies to promote healthy aging among Korean older adults.",

This study examined the association between dietary macronutrient intake and the odds of having cataracts among 1,619 Korean adults aged ≥ 60 years using data from the 2015-2017 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Cataracts were present in 51.8% of participants. Dietary intake was assessed via 24-hour recall and macronutrient intake was categorized by quartiles and energy ratios. After adjusting for covariates, individuals in the highest quartile of carbohydrate-to-energy intake (> 80%) had 41% higher odds of having cataracts (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-2.01), with a significant trend (p for trend = 0.022). In contrast, the highest quartile of protein intake (Q3: 12%-15% energy) was associated with significantly lower odds of having cataracts in women (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.88). Likewise, fat intake exceeding 18% of total energy was associated with reduced odds of having cataracts (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97). Saturated and monounsaturated fat intake also showed inverse associations with the odds of having cataracts. These results suggest that excessive carbohydrate intake, particularly when replacing fats and proteins, may increase the odds of having cataracts in older adults, especially among women. Dietary adjustments aimed at reducing the proportion of carbohydrates and increasing high-quality protein and fat intake may help prevent cataracts in aging populations.

In preliminary studies, powders dried differently were examined for proximate compositions (moisture, ash, total sugar, fat, protein, pigments, vitamin A and mineral) and techno-functional properties. Besides its nutritional quality, pulp contains considerable amounts of total polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins. Accordingly, it has interesting antioxidant power (IC50 = 1.667 μg/mL), indicating rapid and immediate antioxidant activity. These nutritional values and the presence of phenolic compounds qualify this squash pulp powder as a functional and conservable food product.

When choosing a specific RFP variant, the priority may be given to the fluorescence brightness, maturation rate, monomericity, excitation/emission wavelengths, and low toxicity, which are rarely combined in an optimal way in a single protein. If additional requirements such as prolonged fluorescence lifetime and/or blinking ability are applied, the available repertoire of probes could dramatically narrow. Since the entire diversity of conventional single-component RFPs belongs to just a few phylogenetic lines (DsRed-, eqFP578- and eqFP611-derived being the major ones), it is not unexpected that their advantageous properties are split between close homologs. In such cases, a systematic mutagenetic analysis focusing on variant-specific amino acid residues can shed light on the origins of the distinctness between related RFPs and may aid in consolidating their strengths in new RFP variants. For instance, the protein FusionRed, despite being efficient in fluorescence labeling thanks to its good monomericity and low cytotoxicity, has undergone considerable loss in fluorescence brightness/lifetime compared to the parental mKate2. In this contribution, we describe a fast-maturing monomeric RFP designed semi-rationally based on the mKate2 and FusionRed templates that outperforms both its parents in terms of molecular brightness, has extended fluorescence lifetime, and displays a spontaneous blinking pattern that is promising for nanoscopy use.",

D9 and B2 Mabs were raised against serotype O and tested against three more sets of peptides: (1) nine overlapping peptides with one amino acid difference, (2) alanine scanning peptide, both for O1K strain and (3) four mutated peptides one for A22 and three for SAT2 strains in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format with correlation to virus neutralisation test.\n\nThe D9 Mab was bound to peptides corresponding to the G-H loops of serotype O, A, and SAT1 strains, but only neutralised serotype O and SAT1 strains in the virus neutralisation test.

These critical amino acids were further confirmed by designing modified SAT2 and A peptides at these positions, which led to a significant improvement in the binding ability of D9 but not B2.\n\nThese findings help to map cross-reactive epitopes within the G-H loop which may contribute to the inter-serotypic cross-reactivity observed in diagnostic serological assays giving insights that motivate the design of custom peptides that have improved serotype specificity.",

However, data on the prevalence and nutritional contributors to GI symptoms in Chinese recreational long distance runners remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, severity, and dietary influences of GI symptoms in this population.\n\nA total of 805 valid responses were collected through an online and offline questionnaire conducted in China between January and December 2024. Participants were recreational long distance runners recruited via running clubs, community organizations, sports associations, and online platforms. The questionnaire covered six areas: demographics, exercise habits, dietary strategies, GI symptom severity and frequency, influencing factors, and knowledge and attitudes. GI symptoms during races were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), which includes 11 symptoms rated on a 7-point Likert scale.\n\nNotably, 26.1% of participants reported GI symptoms during races, with bloating (18.6%), urge to defecate (17.8%), and stomach pain (16.5%) being the most frequent. Symptoms peaked in prevalence and severity during the middle phase of the race. GI symptoms were more common in males (27.9%) than females (20.8%), and runners aged 34 years and younger had a higher symptom rates. Nutritional factors, particularly pre- and mid-race dietary strategies, significantly influenced symptom occurrence. Foods high in fat, protein, fiber, or fermentable carbohydrates were commonly associated with GI distress. Eating within 30 min before a race increased the risk of bloating and urge to defecate. The use of energy gels, sports drinks, and hydration strategies also correlated with higher GI symptom risk. Other contributing factors included a history of GI issues and high monthly running volume.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of individualized dietary planning to reduce GI symptoms among recreational long distance runners. Adjusting pre-race meal timing and avoiding certain food types may mitigate discomfort. In addition to nutrition, variables such as sex, age, training load, and medical history should be considered in preventive strategies. Future research should explore tailored nutrition and training approaches to improve athlete health and performance during endurance events.",

Beyond its fundamental role in iron homeostasis, ferritin demonstrates growing application value in food engineering, nanocarrier systems, and biomedicine, owing to its unique self-assembly properties, exceptional stability, and biocompatibility. This review systematically summarizes the core structural features and physicochemical properties of ferritin, with a particular focus on its applications across three major domains. In food engineering, ferritin acts as both a carrier for bioactive compounds and a highly efficient, low-irritant iron fortificant, significantly enhancing nutrient stability, solubility, and bioavailability, thereby extending food shelf life. In the nanocarrier field, its nanocage structure provides an ideal platform for constructing nutrient and drug delivery systems, enabling targeted transport and controlled release. In biomedicine, ferritin is utilized in tumor imaging, targeted therapy, and inflammation biomarker detection. Using sturgeon liver ferritin as a specific example, this review details its unique advantages derived from its source, such as distinctive structure, enhanced stability, and application potential. Furthermore, the review identifies key challenges in ferritin research, including structural variability, digestive stability, and long-term safety concerns. It also outlines future research directions, highlighting the immense potential of ferritin in addressing critical challenges like fresh-cut food preservation. With advancing technology and multidisciplinary integration, ferritin is poised to become a powerful interdisciplinary tool.",

Endosymbionts are in host specialised cells, called the bacteriocytes, which in many insects group together to form a symbiotic organ, the bacteriome. The cereal weevil Sitophilus oryzae houses multiple bacteriomes at the adult mesenteric caeca.\n\nUsing microscopic cell imaging, we revealed that bacteriomes consist of several cell types, including progenitor cells, peripheral bacteriocytes, central bacteriocytes and epithelial cells. By combining laser capture microdissection and dual RNA-sequencing, we showed that both host cell types and their associated endosymbionts express distinct transcriptional profiles. The comparison between peripheral bacteriocytes and midgut cells from insects artificially deprived from endosymbionts (aposymbiotic) unravelled cellular pathways modulated by the presence of endosymbionts. The cell-specific response to endosymbionts in peripheral bacteriocytes includes a boost of fatty-acid and amino acid metabolisms. We found that central bacteriocytes overexpress transport and G-protein signalling-related genes when compared to peripheral bacteriocytes, indicating a signalling and/or transport function of these cells. Diet composition strongly impacts host and endosymbiont gene expression and reveals a molecular trade-off among metabolic pathways.\n\nThis study provides evidence on how endosymbionts interfere and enhance metabolic performances of insect bacteriocytes and highlights key genes involved in the bacteriocyte differentiation and metabolic pathways.

Choosing an appropriate diet is necessary to prevent the progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the effects of 3 diets, including intermittent fasting (IF) 5:2, portfolio-moderate-carbohydrate (PMC), and anti-inflammatory (AI) diets, compared to a healthy diet with carbohydrate distribution.\n\nThis open label randomized clinical trial was performed on 98 patients with pre-diabetes that were randomly divided into four intervention groups, including IF 5:2 (n = 24), PMC (n = 24), AI (n = 25), and control group (n = 25).

Its pathology is closely linked to lipid metabolism disorders, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Dietary supplementation has recently emerged as a promising treatment strategy for MAFLD. Broccoli leaves, a by-product of broccoli, are rich in proteins, polysaccharides, polyphenols, flavonoids, and other bioactive compounds.\n\nThis study identified the active components in broccoli leaf crude extract (BLCE) using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and chemical methods, and confirmed its significant antioxidant activity through three in vitro assays. In oleic acid (OA)-induced HepG2 cells, BLCE attenuated the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), restored antioxidant markers (SOD, MDA, and GSH), and reduced intracellular total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells, BLCE significantly inhibited the production of inflammatory factors - tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) - demonstrating anti-inflammatory effects. In a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MAFLD mouse model, BLCE reversed MAFLD by lowering serum and liver lipids, restoring liver function, morphology, and organization, and reducing liver injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Finally, the study identified 487 intersecting genes and screened 20 core targets through network pharmacology. Enrichment analysis revealed that BLCE's anti-MAFLD effects mainly involve hormone regulation, the carboxylic acid metabolic process, and the cAMP signaling pathway. Moreover, molecular docking results showed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a central target, and key compounds in BLCE exhibit significant affinity and bind effectively, contributing to anti-MAFLD effects.\n\nBroccoli leaf crude extract may be an effective dietary supplement for alleviating MAFLD by suppressing hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

This study investigated the therapeutic potential of Ginkgolide B (GB), a bioactive component of Ginkgo biloba leaves, in ameliorating hyperlipidemia and explored its underlying mechanisms. Utilizing a high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rat model and lipidomics analysis, the study showed that GB significantly decreased serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein levels. Lipidomics revealed that GB reversed dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism, notably decreasing ceramides levels and increasing sphingomyelins, which are implicated in metabolic inflammation and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, GB activated PPARα, thereby enhancing fatty acid oxidation and upregulating the Nrf2 pathway to mitigate oxidative damage. These dual effects were validated in vitro using HepG2 cells, where GB reduced lipid accumulation and improved antioxidant defenses. Overall, these findings highlight GB as a promising therapeutic agent for hyperlipidemia by restoring sphingolipid homeostasis and targeting the interplay between lipid metabolism and oxidative stress.",

However, no information is available about chemical composition of CCJ12 and in vivo effects on obesity. Therefore, in this paper, the composition of CCJ12 was analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS, and effects on bodyweight, metabolic (HDL, LDL, TG, leptin, adiponectin), cardiovascular risk (sE-selectin, C-reactive protein,), and inflammatory (MCP-1, TNF-alpha) factors were investigated in a rodent model. In CCJ12, > 700 compounds were identified by LC/MS and the amounts of javamide I/II, caffeine and chlorogenic acids were quantified by HPLC. For the animal study, rats were placed into three groups (each n = 10); (CG group (a control diet with water), FG group (a high fat diet with water), and FCG group (a high fat diet with CCJ12)) and the study was conducted for 20 weeks. The data showed no significant differences in water/food intakes between all three groups. However, the FG and FCG groups showed weight gain, in comparison to the CG group (P < 0.05). Also, the FG and FCG groups showed higher levels of LDL, TG, and leptin than the CG group (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in bodyweight, HDL, LDL, TG, leptin, and adiponectin levels between the FG and FCG groups. Also, no significant differences were noted in sE-selectin, C-reactive protein, and MCP-1 levels between the FG and FCG groups. However, TNF-alpha level was found to be down in the FCG group, in comparison to the FG group (P < 0.05).

While various dietary patterns have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear. This network meta-analysis (NMA) systematically evaluates the impact of eight dietary patterns on cardiovascular risk markers. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing low-fat, Mediterranean, ketogenic, low-carbohydrate, high-protein, vegetarian, intermittent fasting, and DASH diets. A random-effects model analyzed mean differences (MD) in body composition (weight, BMI, waist circumference), lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C), glycemic markers (glucose), and blood pressure (systolic/diastolic). Dietary efficacy was ranked via Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) scores. Among 21 RCTs (1,663 participants), ketogenic (MD -10.5 kg, 95% CI -18.0 to -3.05; SUCRA 99) and high-protein diets (MD -4.49 kg, 95% CI -9.55 to 0.35; SUCRA 71) showed superior efficacy for weight reduction. For waist circumference, ketogenic (MD -11.0 cm, 95% CI -17.5 to -4.54; SUCRA 100) and low-carbohydrate diets (MD -5.13 cm, 95% CI -8.83 to -1.44; SUCRA 77) achieved greatest reductions. DASH diet most effectively lowered systolic blood pressure (MD -7.81 mmHg, 95% CI -14.2 to -0.46; SUCRA 89), while intermittent fasting also demonstrated significant blood pressure-lowering effects (MD -5.98 mmHg, 95% CI -10.4 to -0.35; SUCRA 76).

Minipigs have great potential as models for human diseases, warranting investigation of the performance of the Göttingen minipig as a model for obesity-associated meta-inflammation. Here, we fed 26 pigs a high-fat, fructose and cholesterol diet (HFFC) or a standard diet (SD) for 103 days, resulting in the HFFC group having a 45% higher body weight and 16% larger abdominal circumference by the end of the experiment. Meta-inflammation was shown in the HFFC group by elevated serum concentrations of the acute phase protein C-reactive protein for more than 60 days during development of obesity, accompanied by increased numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Additional obesity-related abnormalities included dyslipidemia, hepatosteatosis and transcriptional changes to genes related to inflammation and metabolism in circulating leukocytes, liver and visceral adipose tissue. Notably, the transcription of genes related to lipid metabolism, namely ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), was elevated in liver, visceral adipose tissue and circulating leukocytes (ABCA1 only) in the HFFC group compared with the SD group. The development of obesity was accompanied by endotoxemia, indicated by a 2.5-fold increase in serum lipopolysaccharide concentration in the HFFC group compared with the SD group, suggesting increased intestinal permeability.

Here we describe an AMP class termed TMcins (for transmembrane helix-containing bacteriocin), in which half of the AMP forms a transmembrane helix. This characteristic allows TMcin to assemble into stable and large oligomeric pores. The biosynthetic locus of TMcin, which was broadly active against Gram-positive bacteria, is distributed throughout two major bacterial phyla, yet bears no homology to previously reported bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters. Our discovery of an AMP class that achieves pore stability otherwise only found in protein toxins transforms our current understanding of AMP structure and function and underscores the continuing importance of phenotype-initiated investigations in uncovering wholly uncharacterized antimicrobials.",

    "combined_text": "System pharmacology reveals the mechanism of action of Shengbai Oral Liquid alleviates chemotherapy-induced leukopenia by interfering the Pro-Platelet Basic Protein: Integrated network study of multi-omics.\n\nEpimedium brevicornu Maxim., when used alone or as the principal component in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas, has the function of restoring internal \"organs\" and relieving fatigue. Shengbai Oral Liquid (SBOL), a TCM formula primarily composed of Epimedium brevicornu Maxim., has demonstrated clinical efficacy in managing chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced leukocytopenia. Nevertheless, its therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear.\n\nElucidate the mechanism of SBOL in treating chemotherapy-induced leukopenia.\n\nA leukopenia model in mice was established using cyclophosphamide (CTX). Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies were performed to investigate mechanistic effects of SBOL at the genetic, protein, and metabolic levels. A comprehensive approach integrating multi-omics and network pharmacology was then employed to predict potential targets and pathways underlying the effects of SBOL. Finally, experiments were performed to validate the underlying molecular mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets.\n\nSBOL (oral treatment for 18 days) significantly increased the white blood cell (WBC) count in the peripheral blood of mice with leukopenia. Additionally, SBOL can significantly increase the quantity and proliferative activity of bone marrow cells (BMCs). Further flow cytometry analysis showed that SBOL can increase the number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in BMCs. Specifically, it increased the populations of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), short term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs), and multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) within the HSPCs. What is more, SBOL can also reduce spleen index and reverse the compensatory increase of HSPCs in the spleen. Transcriptomic analysis indicated SBOL is involved in lipid metabolism and immune regulation, while proteomic analysis identified pathways related to leukocyte migration and chemotaxis. Metabolomic analysis highlighted arachidonic acid and amino acid metabolism. Multi-omics and network pharmacology studies have suggested that Pro-Platelet Basic Protein (PPBP), ALOXE3, and CCR1 are key targets. Experiments confirmed that SBOL significantly elevated levels of hematopoietic factors, including CXCL12, TGF-β1, IL-34, IL-5, and GM-CSF. Additionally, SBOL reversed the decreased expression of PPBP in BMCs and restored serum PPBP levels in these mice with leukopenia.\n\nSBOL significantly alleviates leukopenia induced by chemotherapy. It increases the bone marrow HSPCs counts and elevates serum hematopoietic factors levels in chemotherapy-treated mice, thereby restoring hematopoietic function and boosting WBCs counts. PPBP is closely related to the treatment of chemotherapy induced leukopenia by SBOL.",

Its origin is not fully understood. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) derive from ancestral infections of germinal cells and represent 8 % of the human DNA. They are mostly inactive, but some can be activated. Their aberrant expressions are associated with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. HERV transcription is modulated by TRIM28 and SETDB1, which are also directly implicated in epigenetic processes and modulation of the immune response. We reported HERV overexpressions in CeD children at diagnosis. In the current prospective study, using a PCR real-time Taqman amplification assay, we explored the transcription levels of HERV-H-pol, -HERV-K-pol, and HERV-W-pol, of syncytin 1 (SYN1), SYN2, and HERV-W-env, as well as of TRIM28 and SETDB1 in the whole blood from 51 adults with CeD after years of good compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) as compared to healthy controls (HC) of similar age. The transcriptional levels of every HERV and of TRIM28/SETDB1 were significantly higher in CeD patients than in HC (constantly with p < 0.0001). Positive correlations were found between the RNA levels of TRIM28 or SETDB1 and HERVs in CeD patients. The upregulation of HERVs, TRIM28, and SETDB1 and their positive correlations are suggestive clues of their contribution to the pathophysiology of CeD and might justify the persistent risk of developing, despite GFD, autoimmune diseases, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and cancers, all disorders characterized by enhanced HERV expressions and epigenetic alterations.",

Growing evidence has proved the close association between increased Th17 cells and NAFLD progression. Interleukin-4 Induced Protein 1 (IL4I1), an amino acid oxidase secreted by immune cells, was reported to regulate the Th17 cells, but its exact role in NAFLD progression has not been fully explained yet. We found that IL4I1 was highly expressed in the liver of C57BL/6J mice with NAFLD induced by an 8-week western diet (WD). To explore the IL4I1's effect, mice were injected with AAV8 encoding IL4I1 one week before WD administration. The results showed that IL4I1 overexpression inhibited the NAFLD progression, demonstrated by relieved liver damage and lipid accumulation. The underlying mechanism in which IL4I1 acts on NAFLD might be attributed to the inactivated AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway-mediated the decrease of Th17 cells in liver tissues.

Despite the surge of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, recent studies showed that 40 % of body weight loss is due to lean mass loss, raising the concern about induction of musculoskeletal arthritis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to tackle the progression of metabolic disorders with minimal adverse effects. EphB singaling had been validated in the progression of metabolic syndrome. We leveraged the resolved X-ray crystal structure of the hEphB1 kinase domain to introduce thienopyridine-based analogs (termed STA analogs) that showed potential pan-inhibitory profiles for EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4 with no inhibition for EphB3 tyrosine kinase singaling pathways. STA-013 inhibited EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4 tyrosine kinases selectively, as validated by a premier kinase profiling assay against 140 protein kinases, with no inhibitory profile against EphB3 tyrosine kinase. Systemic injections of STA-013 resulted in weight loss with significant reduction of fat mass and perseverance of lean mass. This was associated with significant improvement in glucose homeostasis, mitigation of insulin resistance, and inhibition of fatty liver in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. This was allied with modulation of respiratory exchange rates during the dark cycle, with no change in food intake. Additionally, STA-013 administration resulted in inhibiting the EphB phosphorylated signal, coupled with increased p-AKT/AKT signaling, to suggest insulin signaling activation. STA-013 showed an elevated signal for InsR-β, which reversed the effect of insulin on InsR degradation, allowing for the restoration of glucose homeostasis and mitigating insulin resistance.",

The chemical pathways leading to hazelnut oxidative rancidity have been well characterized and are faster on free fatty acids. Lipase(s) enzymes are required in oilseeds to hydrolyse the ester bonds to free the single molecule of fatty acids. This step, necessary for germination, is the first event that triggers rancidity. Identifying the lipase(s) in hazelnuts and the biochemical pathways involved in rancidity would lead to an effective strategy to prevent fat deterioration. Different proteins have been characterized in hazelnut seed and great interest has been risen towards the non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) family because they were identified as human allergens. Here we show that Cor a 8 - a member of nsLTPs - is a novel non-regiospecific lipase able to bind to oil-water interfaces and hydrolyse the triacylglycerol (TAG) ester bonds by a non-canonical active site (non-serine dependent). Molecular modelling and molecular dynamics suggest that Cor a 8 is not only able to catalyse the hydrolysis of TAGs but also to stabilize the resulting free fatty acids within the active site. Cor a 8 homologues are present in all land plants, but the specific catalytic amino acids are found only in angiosperms, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for lipid metabolism unique to flowering plants. This study sets the foundation for understanding this new lipid metabolism in plants and its role in rancidity development.",

A total of 844 proteins were identified in YG, with the top 30 ranked by iBAQ (intensity-based Absolute Quantification, a metric reflecting protein abundance) values for further analysis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of YG against V. alginolyticus were determined as 50 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL, respectively. Oxford cup assays revealed concentration-dependent antibacterial effects, with inhibition zones ranging from 6.03 mm to 14.86 mm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations demonstrated that YG treatment disrupted bacterial cell walls, causing membrane damage and leakage of intracellular contents. Enzyme activity assays further confirmed YG-induced bacterial lysis, as indicated by increased alkaline phosphatase (AKP) levels. Additionally, YG significantly reduced bacterial surface hydrophobicity, impairing adhesion capacity. Feeding trials demonstrated that dietary supplementation with YG enhanced immune enzyme activities, including lysozyme, catalase, and nitric oxide synthase, in sea cucumber coelomic fluid. Growth performance parameters such as specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) improved significantly with YG supplementation. In a bacterial challenge experiment, cumulative survival rates increased to 53.33 % in the YG-treated groups compared to the positive control. Intestinal microbiota analysis showed that YG supplementation modified gut microbial composition, reducing species diversity. Histopathological observations indicated reduced tissue damage in YG-fed sea cucumbers post-infection.

Piglets infected with GXFS20220129 exhibited transient fever, coughing, diarrhea, and weight loss, ultimately resulting in the death of 2 out of 4 piglets. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed comparable viral loads in the lung and intestinal tissues of infected piglets.

Identification of multiple metalloproteins from native expression (\"metalloproteomics\") based on a single chromatography has low resolution and/or sensitivity, while classical protein purification lacks the versatility required for purifying multiple proteins for proteomics. We present a new metalloproteomics method based on three dimensions of metal-free liquid chromatography (HPLC) hyphenated online with inductively coupled sector-field mass spectrometry (ICP-sfMS): anion exchange chromatography (AEC) followed by either chromatofocusing (CF) or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and finally size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We used this 3D technique to purify naturally abundant metalloproteins from crude extracts mainly from plants but also from bacteria to a quantity and purity sufficient for protein identification and quantification by mass spectrometry (Tims-TOF-MS). Protein mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD056024. Sensitivity and signal/background ratio were sufficient to identify proteins at concentrations <1 nM and total amounts <1 pmol in the final SEC. As shown by application examples, the method can be immediately applied to various biological materials from a large range of organisms without individual optimization for single proteins or organisms. It can thus be used to resolve mechanisms of metal metabolism in various contexts, e.g., metal deficiency, nutrition, toxicity, and detoxification.",

We evaluated four dietary treatments: a control (CTR) and three experimental diets, each containing 15 % Spirulina: unprocessed (SP), extruded (SPE) and extruded plus 0.21 % enzyme blend (SPEM). Hepatic proteomic profiling identified 25 proteins whose abundance differed significantly (P < 0.05) among treatments. Proteins decreased in all Spirulina-fed groups were predominantly involved in lipid and amino-acid metabolism: hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, homocysteine-binding protein, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1, 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthase and aspartate aminotransferase. Conversely, proteins increased with Spirulina inclusion were mainly associated with carbohydrate catabolism and mitochondrial energy production: fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, multiple NADH dehydrogenase subunits (α, β, 75 kDa), and the voltage-dependent anion channel protein. Importantly, the magnitude of these proteomic shifts was greatest in the SPE and SPEM groups, indicating that extrusion enhances algal cell-wall disruption and nutrient accessibility, while supplemental enzymes further liberate bioactive components. This metabolic reprogramming suggests a shift in the broiler liver toward enhanced glycolytic flux and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Such adaptations may underpin improvements in hepatic function, support more efficient growth performance and bolster overall metabolic health in poultry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that targeted processing of Spirulina can selectively modulate the avian liver proteome, offering a promising strategy for functional feed design.",

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that the surface of Complex III displayed an increased overall size and distinct morphological features, characterized by a uniform, regularly spherical shape with a relatively smooth texture. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy verified that the formation of complexes was facilitated by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, with a notable hydrogen bond interaction occurring between ACN and WPCA-FD. Furthermore, the protective effect (thermal and storage stability) of Complex III was more significant, showed slower ACN release in simulated releasing environment in vitro.

Although adequate energy intake is physiologically necessary during recovery phases, most studies did not report nutritional intake during this period. Protein intake above the standard level helped preserve muscle mass. Nutrition therapy combined with early rehabilitation appears to support physical function. Under the equivalent energy intake, the route and method of administration had minimal impact, but can help ensure adequate delivery. The effects of specific nutrients remain unclear due to limited studies and insufficient or unreported energy intake. Nevertheless, omega-3 fatty acids, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and synbiotics showed potential benefits.\n\nAlthough overfeeding may be harmful during the hyperacute phase, adequate energy intake, at least in the late period of the acute phase and subsequent phases, could play an important role in supporting the recovery of muscle mass and physical function.

    "combined_text": "The impact of environmental toxicants on gestational diabetes mellitus: Investigating the mediating role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a significant metabolic disorder characterized by the elevated glucose level first detected during pregnancy, influencing approximately 14 % of pregnancies globally. Given the rising prevalence of environmental toxicants and their potential impact on maternal health, it is imperative to explore the relationship between environmental exposures and GDM. This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) in this context, demonstrating that exposure to environmental toxicants may influence GDM risk through some pathways. Data from the 2007-2020 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed to assess the association between exposure to 89 environmental toxicants and GDM incidence. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to identify toxicant-GDM associations, with a particular concentration on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and certain metals. Additionally, network pharmacology approaches were employed to predict candidate molecular targets of VOCs and elucidate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) linked to GDM pathophysiology. The Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) and STRING databases were utilized to construct a PPI network. The findings revealed that 29 environmental toxicants exhibited a positive association with GDM, notably among VOCs and selected metals. HDL-C emerged as a potential surrogate marker for systemic inflammation, mediating the correlation between toxicant exposure and GDM risk. Network pharmacology analysis further revealed key pathways and protein targets implicated in the relationship between environmental exposures and GDM pathogenesis. These findings highlight the critical role of environmental toxicants in shaping maternal health outcomes and GDM susceptibility. By identifying HDL-C as a mediator, this study offers novel insights into the inflammatory mechanisms driving GDM development. Public health strategies must prioritize addressing environmental toxicant exposure to reduce GDM risk and improve maternal-fetal health outcomes.",

We also investigated associations between baseline AAbs and time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier models.\n\nCompared with healthy controls, patients with rare tumors had significantly higher levels of several AAbs at baseline, including those against interferon alpha antigens. Ten patients (24%) had CB.

However, the functional roles of HD-ZIP subfamily II genes, particularly in pepper (Capsicum annuum), remain inadequately studied, and their involvement in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling is not fully elucidated. In this study, we isolated the HD-ZIP subgroup II gene CaDRHB12 (C. annuum drought-responsive homeobox gene 12), which shares sequence homology with CaHAT1, a previously identified positive regulator of drought tolerance. Unlike that of CaHAT1, CaDRHB12 expression was significantly downregulated upon ABA and drought stress treatment. Functional analyses of CaDRHB12 in pepper and Arabidopsis plants revealed that CaDRHB12 negatively regulates ABA signalling and drought stress responses. Furthermore, CaDRHB12 interacted with CaSnRK2.6, an ABA signalling-related kinase that associates with and phosphorylates CaHAT1. In vitro and in vivo kinase assays demonstrated that CaSnRK2.6 also directly phosphorylates CaDRHB12, promoting CaDRHB12 protein degradation. This degradation was not observed in CaDRHB12 phospho-dead and CaSnRK2.6 kinase-dead mutants. Additionally, the transcriptional activity of CaDRHB12 was influenced by its phosphorylation status and CaSnRK2.6 function, highlighting the critical role of CaSnRK2.6-mediated phosphorylation in regulating CaDRHB12 protein. Collectively, our findings suggest that CaDRHB12 negatively regulates pepper drought tolerance, and its protein stability is modulated by CaSnRK2.6-mediated phosphorylation under drought stress conditions.

Laboratory experiments in this field are often expensive, and therefore large-scale computational protein inference from readily available amino acid sequences is needed to understand in more detail the mechanisms underlying biological processes in living organisms. Recently, studies have utilised mathematical ideas from natural language processing and self-supervised learning, to derive features based on protein sequence information. In the area of language modelling, it has been shown that learnt representations from self-supervised pre-training can capture the semantic information of words well for downstream applications. In this study, we tested the ability of sequence-based protein representations learnt using self-supervised pre-training on a large protein database, on multiple protein inference tasks. We show that simple baseline representations in the form of bag-of-words histograms perform better than those based on self-supervised learning, on sequence similarity and protein inference tasks. By feature selection we show that the top discriminant features help bag-of-words capture important information for data-driven function prediction. These findings could have important implications for self-supervised learning models on protein sequences, and might encourage the consideration of alternative pre-training schemes for learning representations that capture more meaningful biological information from the sequence alone.",

The most common form is associated with auto-antibodies to leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) protein, the presentation of which includes frequent focal seizures. The exact cause of these auto-antibodies remains unknown, but established predispositions include overrepresented human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Yet, these HLA alleles are themselves common in the healthy ancestry-matched population. One potential etiological hypothesis is that an environmental trigger, such as the gut microbiome, interacts with a genetically predisposed individual.\n\nTo investigate this, we studied 42 patients with LGI1-antibody encephalitis (LGI1-Ab-E) and 27 familial/environmentally matched controls, and performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing, to describe the compositional and functional differences in the gut microbiome.\n\nWe observed that LGI1-Ab-E gut microbiomes exhibited a significant reduction in the ratio of Firmicutes (or Bacillota) and Bacteroidetes phyla, which is associated with the dosage of HLA susceptibility allele count in patients with LGI1-Ab-E. Furthermore, we identified differences in functional gene profiles in the gut microbiome that led to a reduction of neuroinflammatory protective short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in LGI1-Ab-E patients.\n\nTaken together, our results suggest that a compositional shift in the gut microbiome of LGI1-Ab-E associates with a neuroinflammatory state, possibly through the reduction of SCFA production. Our study highlights the potential of the gut microbiome to explain some of the complex condition and unravel etiological questions. Validation studies with greater sample sizes are recommended.",

Herein, a novel shell matrix protein gene, HcN13, was identified from the mussels Hyriopsis cumingii. Sequence analysis indicated that HcN13 belongs to the FGF-BP1 family. Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analysis showed that HcN13 is expressed in the dorsal epithelial cells of the mantle center, indicating that HcN13 is a shell nacreous layer matrix protein. The expression of HcN13 in the mantle significantly increased during the regeneration of the prismatic and nacreous layers. Furthermore, the suppression of HcN13 at both the transcriptional and protein levels resulted in the complete destruction of the prisms and nacre tablets in vivo. However, the addition of SUMO-HcN13 did not affect the polymorphism and morphology of the crystals in vitro. These results indicated that HcN13 may serve as a modulator that influences downstream signaling pathways to further regulate shell formation. Additionally, HcN13 was highly expressed in hemocytes during pearl nacre disorder deposition and was also highly expressed in the mantle during pearl nacre order deposition, indicating that HcN13 is essential for pearl biomineralization. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the presence of FGF-BPs in the mollusk shell, highlighting their essential role in biomineralization in invertebrates.",

The use of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics stands out for the production of vaccines based on peptides or proteins, since they are more specific, safe, effective and economical. The present study evaluated the immunological potential of the proteins MPT83 and MPT51 for vaccine production, comparing them with MPT64. To do this, the sequences of these proteins from MTB H37Rv were downloaded and analyzed. The prediction of T and B cell epitopes was performed, and the adjuvant (50 S L7/L12) was included in the fusion of MPT83 and MPT51 to enhance the immune response. The allergenicity, antigenicity, solubility and physicochemical properties of the fused protein fragments were evaluated. Through different programs, a variety of bioinformatics tools were used to predict, analyze and validate the tertiary structure. The results of the in silico immunological simulation of the chimeric protein demonstrated that the best region for use as an epitope is the initial part of MPT83, consisting of 100 amino acid residues, and the final portion of MPT51, consisting of 99 amino acid residues, with a significant immunological response, excellent antigenicity (1.02) and no allergenicity. The secondary structure revealed that the majority of alpha-helices are in the initial part of the proteins, and the chimeric vaccine has 3 beta strands along its length. Finally, the chimeric vaccine candidate and MPT64 were efficiently cloned into the bacterial vector and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli thereby facilitating future in vivo studies with potentially promising results.",

However, there is no consensus on the concentrations at which PPs exert their anti-lipogenic activity, and it remains unclear whether different PPs activate distinct molecular pathways. PPs are a diverse group of plant-derived secondary metabolites with recognized anti-obesogenic potential. While their inhibitory effects on adipogenesis are well established, their role in modulating lipid metabolism in fully differentiated adipocytes remains less well understood. Emerging evidence from studies on mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes indicates that PPs can influence key metabolic processes, including lipid storage and mobilization. These findings highlight the potential of PPs as modulators of adipose tissue metabolism, while also emphasizing the need for translational research to clarify their mechanisms of action and therapeutic efficacy in vivo.",

While GCs suppress inflammation through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), they also cause metabolic side effects. Investigating alternative pathways beyond GR activation is crucial for reducing these side effects. Our phosphoproteomics analysis revealed that glucocorticoid exposure promotes phosphorylation at the RxxS motifs of multiple proteins in preadipocytes, including those mediated by Serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 3 (SGK3). SGK3 is a key mediator of glucocorticoid-induced adipogenesis, as shown by impaired adipogenesis following SGK3 inhibition or genetic ablation. Sgk3 knockout mice were resistant to glucocorticoid- or high-fat diet-induced obesity, and PROTAC targeting SGK3 reduced adipogenesis in both obese mice and a thyroid eye disease cell line. Mechanistically, SGK3 translocated to the nucleus upon glucocorticoid stimulation, interacted with and phosphorylated the BRG1 subunit of the BAF complex, and prevented BRG1 degradation, promoting chromatin remodeling necessary for adipogenesis.

    "combined_text": "Effects of ageing and exercise training on cerebrovascular vasomotor reactivity, depressive behaviour and the hippocampal transcriptome.\n\nThe ageing global population is experiencing an increased prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke and dementia. This highlights a need for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of age-related cerebrovascular alterations, alongside benefits of interventions such as physical activity. Therefore, our aims were to: (1) examine the impact of ageing and exercise training on cerebrovascular function and (2) to characterize age- and exercise training-related changes in the hippocampus transcriptome. Young and old male rats were randomized to a sedentary condition or exercise training for 10 weeks. In the first protocol, cerebral arteries were isolated to test vasomotor reactivity, quantify gene/protein expression and assess nitric oxide production. In the second protocol, anhedonia was assessed and hippocampal tissue collected for RNA-sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses (i.e. protein-protein interaction mapping) were performed. Ageing impaired endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity in the posterior communicating artery (PCoA), with a shift from endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS)- to neuronal NOS-mediated vasorelaxation, as well as alterations in oxidative stress production. In support, PCoA superoxide-mediated vasoreactivity and neuronal NOS-mediated production of NO decreased with age. Exercise enhanced vasodilatation in young rats, but the results suggested reduced cerebrovascular plasticity in older animals. In the second protocol, exercise training attenuated the age-related increase in anhedonia behaviour. Hippocampal RNA-sequencing revealed altered inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways with ageing that were mitigated by exercise training. Our findings underscore the complex interplay between vascular/neuronal factors in the ageing brain. Furthermore, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of exercise in mitigating the adverse effects of ageing on cerebral health. KEY POINTS: Ageing is associated with increased risks of cerebrovascular disease and neurocognitive decline. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms involved in this process, limiting our ability to design appropriate interventions. Ageing is associated with alterations in cerebrovascular function, including possible changes in the mechanisms underlying vasomotor reactivity. Hippocampal RNA-seq revealed age-related alterations in neuronal, vascular, immune and oxidative-stress related signalling pathways. Exercise training may have mitigated many of these age-related changes, suggesting that enhancing physical activity may be a feasible means to preserve cerebral health in older individuals.",

Studying the mitochondrial ATP synthase in primary hippocampal neurons and their released EVs, we discovered that the abundance of ATP synthase in NEVs echoes the catalytic activity level of ATP synthase in neurons. We also observed, unexpectedly, that within the neuron, the quantity of ATP synthase remains constant irrespective of the level of its activity. Using non-canonical amino acid tagging coupled with proximity ligation assay, we found that the amount of nascent ATP synthase is linearly correlated to its activity, which may contribute to maintaining the overall quantity of ATP synthase in the neuron stable. Furthermore, we identified a sub-population of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) that carry ATP synthase and are not targeted to lysosomal degradation. Our findings suggest a strategy used by neurons in regulating and fine-tuning mitochondrial ATP synthase through MDV and NEV generation.

High-fat diets (HFD) disrupt glucose and lipid metabolism and promote ectopic lipid deposition, leading to renal lipotoxicity and dysfunction. We recently reported that grape pomace extract (GPE), rich in phenolic compounds, has beneficial effects on obesity-related metabolic disorders. This study investigates whether GPE supplementation could revert or attenuate HFD-induced renal damage in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard diet (16% calories from fat) or HFD (60% calories from fat) with or without GPE (300 mg per kg body weight per day) for 16 weeks. Chronic consumption of HFD induced several obesity-related alterations such as increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT), insulin resistance, dyslipidemia along with altered markers of kidney function (higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and kidney protein levels of Kim-1). This was associated with increased kidney lipid accumulation, glomerular and tubular injury and fibrosis. Supplementation with GPE mitigated all these adverse effects. GPE protected kidney function by modulating cell signals involved in energy metabolism (p-AMPK/p-ACC), inflammation (NLRP3/caspase-1/NF-κB/TNF-α pathway) and oxidative stress (oxidant species production and Nox4 downregulation). These findings support the use of grape-derived bioactive compounds, to counteract obesity-related renal injury.",

Whereas proteins that moved up from the lower quartiles - Q2 (n = 228), Q3 (115) and Q4 (63) - indicate leukocytes and fibroblasts, and endothelial cells; demonstrating that signatures of inflammation and endothelial activation increase with disease progression. Notably, 86 and 146 proteins were increased at 3 and 6 months, including MMP-12 and COL6A3.

We and others have previously described \"mass offset\" or multi-notch searches that sit in between closed and open searches, allowing simultaneous search for hundreds of modifications with more straightforward downstream interpretation than open search. The original mass offset searches were closer to open search, lacking the ability to restrict modifications to specific amino acids. Here, we describe a new \"detailed\" mass offset (DMO) search implemented in the MSFragger search engine, which allows each mass offset to have its own site restrictions and fragmentation rules. The benefits of DMO search over existing mass offset searches are shown with three example searches of complex modification sets: nearly one hundred post-translational modifications, fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP)-derived modifications, and amino acid substitutions. The DMO search further improves the interpretability of results by reducing ambiguity in site localization, particularly when modifications have overlapping masses, and provides benefits that scale with the complexity of the search.",

In plants, this is exemplified by the deeply conserved CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIPIII) family of TFs. HD-ZIPIII activity is controlled by inputs at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. As part of their multidomain architecture, HD-ZIPIII TFs contain a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, a ubiquitously distributed evolutionary module that binds various types of lipophilic ligands. Here, we show that HD-ZIPIII and HD-ZIPIV proteins contain a cryptic, deeply conserved START domain which we term the disorder-containing START domain (dSTART). The dSTART domain is required for HD-ZIPIII developmental function, controlling their subcellular localization and DNA-binding properties. The dSTART domain also helps discriminate responsive from non-responsive binding sites across the HD-ZIPIII shared genetic network. Finally, we identify candidate ligands of the dSTART domain including several species of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid.

To address this, herein, we propose a novel green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based reporter optimized to visualize the enzymatic activity of picornaviral 3C proteases in cells by using the conformational change of a GFP variant induced by the 3C protease, generating fluorescence emission linked to the enzymatic activity. Upon treatment of picornaviruses with a known 3C protease inhibitor, the fluorescence decreased in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that the signal depended on the activity of the 3C protease.

Here, we explored the impact of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on the phenotypic transition of VSMCs. Our findings revealed that FGF21 expression was substantially down-regulated in both human and mouse neointimal regions. Additionally, plasma FGF21 levels were lower in patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (ASCAD) compared to those without ASCAD. Similarly, patients with restenosis exhibited reduced FGF21 levels compared to those without restenosis. In vivo, FGF21 deficiency accelerated intimal hyperplasia and decreased the number of contractile VSMCs in mouse neointima. However, hepatocyte-specific FGF21 knockout had no effect on ligation-induced intimal hyperplasia. Conversely, administration of recombinant FGF21 protein reduced neointima formation. This effect was abolished in mice with β-klotho VSMC-specific knockout, suggesting a direct effect of FGF21 on VSMCs. In vitro, FGF21 could promote the contractile phenotype transition of human aortic smooth muscle cells under basal or platelet-derived growth factor-BB incubation conditions. Furthermore, FGF21 activation led to the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which subsequently formed a complex with the serum response factor (SRF)-myocardin complex. This complex increased the phosphorylation of SRF at serine 224, thereby enhancing the transcription activation of the SRF-myocardin complex. Finally, we revealed that treatment with the FGF21 analog efruxifermin or activation of p38 MAPK using anisomycin effectively inhibited neointima formation. Taken together, these results indicate that modulating FGF21 or its subsequent signal pathways could serve as a therapeutic strategy for vascular diseases characterized by abnormal VSMC phenotypic transition.",

Adolescence has been associated with increased interest among of young people, especially boys, in strength-related and endurance sports or body-building. Anabolic androgen steroid use is a public health threat. The present study aimed to estimate the effect of endurance training, two doses of testosterone, and the combination of these stimuli on the level and activity of proteins related to the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathways in the spinal cord in adolescent male rats.\n\nAdult male Wistar rats were trained using a motor-driven treadmill for 6 weeks (40-60 min, 5 times per week) and/or were treated for 6 weeks with two doses of testosterone (i.m.; 8 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg body weight). At the end of the experiment, spinal cord samples were collected for further evaluation.\n\nMajor findings from the study are that a high dose of testosterone increases proteins related to the NO signaling pathway (eNOS, nNOS, CGβ1, PKC), but decreases trophic factors (BDNF, VEGF) and p-Akt. Endurance training by itself increases the spinal protein levels of CGβ1, VEGF, and kinases -p-Akt and PKC, but decreases kinase p-p38 MAPK; and the combination of endurance training and high doses of testosterone enhances changes in the protein level of nNOS, p-p38 and p-Akt. In conclusion, at least some of the effects of endurance training and testosterone may be related to the intensity of NO-related signal transmission and protein kinase systems.",

    "combined_text": "Oridonin Ameliorates Metabolic-Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease by Inhibiting PANoptosis via Modulating SIRT2/NLRP3 Pathway.\n\nMetabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Various studies have demonstrated that traditional Chinese medicine alleviates MAFLD by suppressing PANoptosis. Although Oridonin (ORI) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used in hepatosteatosis, its underlying mechanism for treating MAFLD, especially regarding PANoptosis, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the ameliorative effects of ORI on MAFLD by inhibiting PANoptosis and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. A vivo model of MAFLD was constructed by feeding mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. ORI was simultaneously intragastric gavaged for 12 weeks. A vitro model of MAFLD was constructed by palmitic acid (PA) induced AML12 cells for 24 h; ORI was simultaneously induced for 24 h. Extraction of mice plasma for detecting lipid-related and oxidative stress-related assay kits was performed. Lipid metabolism and PANoptosis-related proteins and pathways were validated both in vivo and in vitro through western blotting and immunofluorescence. The functions of the candidate proteins were further investigated using the plasmid transfection technique. Then the Biotin labeling assays were used to analyze the proteins' direct interaction with ORI. ORI treatment significantly alleviated HFD-induced inflammation and PANoptosis. Likewise, ORI effectively attenuated PANoptosis induced by PA in the AML12 cells. Additionally, over-expression of NLRP3, which is a key component in PANoptosis, could partly antagonize the inhibiting effects of ORI on steatosis and PANoptosis. Next, our findings demonstrated the increased NLRP3 acetylation level in PA-induced cells, while ORI treatment decreased the NLRP3 acetylation level. Further studies revealed that ORI could bind to and activate SIRT2 to increase the protein expression and stability of SIRT2, which in turn deacetylated and inactivated NLRP3. Moreover, over-expression of NLRP3 could partly antagonize the inhibiting effects of ORI on lipid droplet deposition and PANoptosis, which could be rescued by over-expression of SIRT2. Therefore, these findings show that ORI can alleviate MAFLD by suppressing PANoptosis via inhibiting the SIRT2/NLRP3 pathway. These findings provide new therapeutic targets and mechanisms for the treatment of MAFLD.",

Hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) functions as a receptor for various diet-derived metabolites. Although a growing body of evidence indicates these metabolites exert beneficial effects on depression, the precise mechanisms underlying these benefits require further investigation.\n\nWe established a mouse model of corticosterone (Cor)-induced depression to evaluate the therapeutic potential of HCAR2 activation on depression. A series of behavioral experiments were conducted to investigate whether HCAR2 activation could alleviate depressive-like behaviors in mice. The neuroprotective effects of HCAR2 in the hippocampus were examined using Nissl and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in mouse serum were quantified, as well as the cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of hippocampal neurons co-cultured with primary microglia. Microglia-associated neuroinflammation was evaluated by quantifying pro-inflammatory cytokines using ELISA, and by assessing the polarization state of M1 microglia, including the mRNA expression levels of M1 markers and double fluorescence staining for inducible nitric oxide synthase/ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (iNOS/Iba1). The expression level of proteins in the protein kinase B-inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunits alpha and beta-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (AKT-IKKαβ-NFκB) pathway in primary microglia was analyzed using western blot. Transcriptomic changes in microglia induced by HCAR2 activation were examined through RNA sequencing. Mice were fed PLX5622 chow to deplete microglia\n\nActivation of HCAR2 by its agonist MK-6892 in a Cor-induced model of depression significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors, attenuated hippocampal neuronal injury, increased serum monoamine levels, reduced microglia-associated neuroinflammation, and inhibited the expression of proteins in the AKT-IKKαβ-NFκB pathway in primary microglia. Additionally, HCAR2 activation markedly enhanced hippocampal neuronal viability and decreased LDH activity in this co-culture system. Importantly, these protective effects were abolished in HCAR2 knockout mice. RNA sequencing revealed that HCAR2 activation induced changes in multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the depletion of microglia also eliminated the protective effects of MK-6892.\n\nActivation of HCAR2 can reduce depressive-like behaviors, neuronal injury, and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest these neuroprotective effects are, at least in part, mediated through modulation of microglial activity by HCAR2.",

Hence, the impact of Bacillus subtilis strain 7A on the nutritional composition and antidiabetic efficacy of fermented VBS (FVBS) at 45°C was investigated. Proximate analyses, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-flame ionization detector (GC-MS-FID) profiling of phytochemicals, and in vitro antioxidants potentials of VBS and FVBS were determined using established protocols. Diabetes was induced via intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg) in Wistar rats, and animals with blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL, which were diabetic, were treated with high-fat diet (HFD) containing varied proportions of FVBS (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) and HFD+ metformin (100 mg/kg) for 21 days.

In view of the rising burden of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and CKD on a global scale, there is currently a great need for drugs that can effectively prevent the onset and reverse or slow down the progression of CKD in diverse patient populations. Over the last decades, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can exert cardioprotective and nephroprotective actions. In the present narrative review, we aimed to specifically describe the cardiorenal protective effects of dihydropyridine CCBs (particularly lercanidipine and manidipine, based on the available evidence) and non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem). With regard to this research topic, we also reviewed the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [endorsed by the International Society of Hypertension (ISH) and the European Renal Association (ERA)] and the 2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies. Finally, we proposed practical criteria for prescribing the most appropriate CCB (among dihydropyridine CCBs and non-dihydropyridine CCBs) for patients with hypertension and proteinuric CKD (with or without diabetes) in different clinical settings.",

Furthermore, we found that fasting and exercise up-regulated the expressions of AMPK, PGC-1α, Glut-4, SIRT1, and PPAR-γ protein, and down-regulated the expression of FoxO1 protein, modulating the ability of the liver and skeletal muscle to uptake glucose and convert glucose-lipid metabolism.

If left untreated, it may cause serious issues, often presenting first as xanthomas on the skin and other tissues.\n\nA 9-year-old female Chinese Zhuang patient developed her first xanthomas on her knees at the age of 4, which progressively spread across her body over the years. Initial blood tests revealed elevated plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, and she was misdiagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia, leading to ineffective treatment. Despite visiting several hospitals, the underlying cause remained unidentified, and the patient was eventually admitted to our hospital for further evaluation. The complete blood count showed mild hypochromic microcytic anemia and blood smears showed microcytic hypochromic anemia and the presence of giant platelets in the peripheral blood. Plasma phytosterol profiling revealed significantly elevated phytosterol levels, and whole exome sequencing detected a homozygous mutation in the ABCG5 gene (c.751C > T, p.Q251*). On the basis of these findings, the patient was diagnosed with sitosterolemia. Her parents and younger brother were found to carry the heterozygous mutation but exhibited no clinical symptoms. In addition, iron metabolism tests and DNA copy number multidetection technology, along with single nucleotide polymorphism typing, revealed that the patient also had a silent alpha-thalassemia trait (genotype: HBA, -α3.7/αα).\n\nSitosterolemia is a rare lipid metabolism disorder that should be considered in patients presenting with multiple xanthomas, severe hypercholesterolemia, or elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Diagnosis can be confirmed through phytosterol detection and molecular testing. Early diagnosis allows for dietary recommendations-such as restricting cholesterol and phytosterol intake-and, if necessary, treatment with medications such as ezetimibe. As we know, alpha-thalassemia is able to cause microcytosis and phytosterolemia may cause stomatocytosis in peripheral blood. However, there are no reports of two gene mutations occurring simultaneously in the same individual, and no stomatocytosis was observed in our patient. Hence, this suggests that the mutual regulation of two diseases and the effects on red blood cell membranes may exist, and the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon are valuable for further research.",

Studies have identified a potential link between cardiovascular disease and LBMD, and the role of lipid metabolism in this has attracted widespread attention. We analyzed participant information collected from multiple NHANES cycles using weighted multivariable logistic regression, subgroup analysis, restricted cubic splines (RCS) curve analysis, and causal mediation analysis. Non-high-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein ratio (NHHR) was significantly negatively associated with low bone mass disorders in a fully adjusted model. We found that NHHR exhibited an L-shaped relationship with the prevalence of LBMD, with a negative association when NHHR < 3.38 and no significant association when NHHR > 3.38. So we could manage both disorders through NHHR. Causal mediation analysis demonstrated that NHHR was a partial mediator of the effect of body mass index (BMI) on low bone mass disorders (LBMD), accounting for 2.3% of the total effect. This suggests that part of the effect in weight affecting low bone mass disorders is mediated by the NHHR. This inspires us to utilize NHHR to guide weight management.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study explores the influence of dietary inulin on embryonic implantation using a sow model. Sows were fed a diet supplemented with 11 g/kg of inulin during early gestation and were slaughtered on gestation day 19 (G19). Uterine fluid exosomes (UFEs) and endometrial tissues were collected for high-throughput sequencing and for analysis of the expression of angiogenesis-related genes and proteins, respectively. Furthermore, UFEs obtained from slaughtered sows were injected into G19 sows to investigate the effects on reproduction and angiogenesis.\n\nThe results showed that inulin significantly increased the number of blood vessels in the endometrium and expression of the angiogenesis-related proteins MMP2 and ANGPT1 in G19 sows (P < 0.05). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that inulin significantly downregulated miRNAs associated with angiogenesis inhibition in UFEs, while upregulating miRNAs related to trophoblast physiological activities and regulation of the uterine fluid microenvironment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, intravenous injection of G19 sows with UFEs from sows fed a diet containing inulin had significantly promoted vascular formation in the endometrium and embryos, and increased the number of live embryos on gestation day 28 (G28) (P < 0.05). Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of MMP2, ANGPT1, and VEGF in the placentas of sows were significantly elevated on G28 and at farrowing in the UFEs injection group (P < 0.05).\n\nDietary supplementation with inulin during early gestation in sows promoted embryo implantation by regulating angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface through the modulation of miRNA expression in UFEs. These findings provide a theoretical reference for the application of dietary fiber in sow nutrition.",

    "combined_text": "Inhibitory efficacy, production dynamics, and characterization of postbiotics of lactic acid bacteria.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to human health and food safety. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce bioactive compounds, known as postbiotics, that act as promising natural preservatives with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial spectrum, production dynamics, and physicochemical properties of postbiotics derived from five LAB strains: Lactobacillus plantarum NBRC 3070, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ATCC 27673. The antimicrobial activity of these postbiotics was assessed against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. A crude bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS), a postbiotic component, was partially purified using ammonium sulfate purification and characterized enzymatically. Its molecular weight was estimated by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that postbiotics, particularly those from L. plantarum and L. acidophilus, exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The inhibitory effect was most pronounced against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus after a 16-h exposure. The postbiotics production peaked between 24 and 36 h of incubation, achieving 85.71-89.28% inhibition. These postbiotics remained stable at high temperatures (up to 121 °C), across a wide pH range (3-5 and 9-11), and under varying salt concentrations. Neutralized cell-free supernatants from L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. rhamnosus GG retained antimicrobial activity, and enzyme treatments confirmed the proteinaceous nature of the BLIS. SDS-PAGE revealed diffuse protein bands between < 3.3 and 6.5 kDa. Lyophilization enhanced the concentration and stability of antibacterial compounds by reducing water content. In addition to BLIS, LAB strains produced other antimicrobial metabolites, including lactic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, fatty acids, and notably, oleic acid. These postbiotic components remained effective after one month of storage at 4 °C and 20 °C for one month. The novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive characterization of postbiotics from well-established LAB strains across multiple functional parameters. Overall, the findings suggest that these LAB-derived postbiotics are stable, effective, and hold potential as natural antimicrobial agents in food preservation.",

One of these sites has recently been reported to be critical for binding EEEV to the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), an EEEV receptor protein. The proteins apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) isoforms 1 and 2, and LDLR have also been shown to function as EEEV receptors. Herein, we investigate the individual contribution of each HS interaction site to EEEV HS- and protein receptor-dependent infection in vitro and EEEV replication in animals. We show that each site contributes to both EEEV-HS and EEEV-protein receptor interactions, providing evidence that altering these interactions can affect disease in mice and eliminate mosquito infectivity. Thus, multiple HS-binding sites exist in EEEV E2, and these sites overlap functionally with protein receptor interaction sites, with each type of interaction contributing to tissue infectivity and disease phenotypes.",

However, few materials possess the function. β-amino acid polymers have demonstrated cell adhesion property, easy preparation, and robust stability to resist proteolysis as emerging biomaterials. Here, we develop amphiphilic β-amino acid polymers that demonstrate exceptional osteoblast vs fibroblast selectivity, outperforming the natural osteoblast-selective KRSR peptide. The optimal polymer selectively supports osteoblast adhesion by manipulating the adsorption of serum proteins and the presentation of RGD motifs on polymer-modified surfaces. In vivo study using polymer-modified titanium-implants in female rat maxillary bone reveals that the optimal polymer substantially promotes osseointegration of titanium-implants compared to uncoated titanium-implants, which tend to develop fibrous encapsulation. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy in designing osteoblast-selective biomaterials and implies the promising application of β-amino acid polymer as emerging osteoblast-selective biomaterials to promote osseointegration.",

Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING Finger Domains 1 (UHRF1) is an important epigenetic regulatory protein involved in regulating cellular life processes, developing many diseases. However, its potential role in regulating embryonic vascular development and postnatal angiogenesis is unclear. Our study found that endothelial cell-specific UHRF1 knockout mice showed obvious developmental disorders at the embryonic stage (E11.5-15.5), including impaired development of the individual embryo size and organs, sparse vascularity in the yolk sac, or even death. In the lower limb ischemia model, UHRF1 expression in ischemic muscle tissues of mice is proportionate to the regeneration of blood vessels. To confirm the specific inhibition of UHRF1, we transfected an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 which inserted a TIE-2 promoter and mediated the delivery of short hairpin RNA (AAV9-TIE-2-shUHRF1) into mouse vascular endothelial cells to knock down UHRF1 specifically. We observed that the knockdown of UHRF1 in endothelial cells results in poorer lower limb perfusion in mice. Mechanically, UHRF1 knockdown decreased the tube-forming capacity of ECFCs, whereas overexpression of UHRF1 by diabetic ECFCs where UHRF1 expression is typically downregulated significantly increased the tube-forming capacity of the cells. RNAseq and related bioinformatics analyses showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly involved in angiogenesis-related pathways. The results of qPCR and western blot showed that the protein and mRNA levels of angiogenesis-related factors (VEGF, PDGF, and ANGPT1), as well as vascular endothelial surface marker molecules (VEGFR2, CD31, and c-Kit), were down-regulated accordingly. Furthermore, ChIP experiments showed that UHRF1 was able to bind the promoters of VEGFR2 and CD31, affecting the levels of histone-methylated protein (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) enriched in the promoter region. However, the expression of CD31 and VEGFR2 can be reversed separately after the transformation of different histone-methylated protein levels (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3). Taken together, UHRF1 may regulate angiogenic gene expression and vascular endothelial cell differentiation through epigenetic mechanisms and is essential for angiogenesis.",

The emergence of enzalutamide (Enz), a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor, has effectively extended the median survival of these patients. However, drug resistance frequently develops during clinical use. Multiple studies have suggested that ferroptosis inducers can reverse cancer resistance to Enz, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that CRPC cells exhibit a concentration-dependent decrease in ferroptosis in response to Enz. This change is attributed to the upregulation of the protein level of SLC7A11. Protein stability assays and database analyses showed that SLC7A11 undergoes post-translational modification, likely connected to Enz-mediated downregulation of the SLC7A11-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L. This phenomenon was significantly reversed by the addition of erastin, a targeted inhibitor of the cystine/glutamate transport system Xc-. The data from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that combining Enz with erastin significantly inhibits the proliferation of drug-resistant CRPC cells, thereby enhancing tumor suppression. These findings offer novel insights into targeting SLC7A11 with erastin as a potential strategy to overcome Enz resistance.",

In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of γ- and δ-tocopherol contents in rice using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and post-GWAS analysis. Accordingly, 34,323 SNP markers were obtained from 179 genotypically diverse accessions of O. sativa. Minor tocopherol contents had a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76) with each other and varied greatly across the accessions: 0.015-1.74 and 0.005-0.81 (µg/g) for γ and δ, respectively. A total of 18 QTL on nine rice chromosomes were mapped. Eight transcription factor (TF) genes, five lncRNAs, and two transposons were found to be associated with the QTL. Moreover, three intracellular transport proteins were identified as associated genes with γ-tocopherol on chromosomes 1, 2, and 6. Protein kinases seem to have a substantiative function in defining the minor tocopherol contents, as they were associated with all 18 identified QTL. Haplotype analysis revealed that the QTL, namely qDelt2.1, qGam2.1, and qGam6.1, can maintain significant haplogroups. Comparative transcript analysis between high and low-content minor tocopherols demonstrated the possible involvement of ERF71 (Os06g0194000), TOR (Os05g0235300) and NAC70 (Os02g0822400) in defining the minor tocopherol contents in rice.

Pathogenic missense variants in the same gene may act through different modes of action (i.e., gain/loss-of-function) by affecting different aspects of protein function.

In total 12 variants were detected, all of which were missense variants. c.1064G>A (p.Arg355His) was the most common one, accounting for 21.4% (3/14). Three GCDH gene variants, including 1297G>C (p.Ala433Pro), c.467G>A (p.Gly156Asp) and c.1125T>G (p.Cys375Trp), were previously unreported. REVEL software analysis predicted that all of the three variants were harmful. 3D protein structure modeling indicated that the three variants may cause amino acid residue alterations, and c.1297G>C (p.Ala433Pro) and c.1125T>G (p.Cys375Trp) may result in increase in hydrogen bonds and affect the function of GCDH protein. By December 2023, one of the eight children had deceased, and another child had severe clinical symptoms with poor prognosis. Six children had a good prognosis, of which two had mild motor development delay and four had normal development without clinical symptoms.\n\nThe incidence of GA1 in newborns screened by MS/MS in Henan Province is 1/101 828, and the carrier rate of pathogenic GCDH variants is 1/160. The c.1064G>A (p.Arg355His) may be the hotspot variant of the GCDH gene among children with GA1 in Henan. Discovery of the three novel variants has enriched the mutational spectrum of the GCDH gene and provide a basis for the early diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and genetic counseling of this disease.",

Increased awareness and availability of a novel biomarker for detecting glomerular filtration rate reduction (symmetric dimethylarginine), alongside efforts by the International Renal Interest Society to standardise diagnosis and staging, have led to earlier detection of CKD and an ability to study and trial interventions in sub-populations based on disease severity. As weight loss and phosphorus dyshomeostasis are present in non-azotaemic cats, and progression to azotaemic CKD may occur over time, earlier diagnosis and management represent a compelling opportunity for optimising management of this disease. To date, however, dietary modification (particularly protein- and phosphorus-restriction) in cats with azotaemic CKD is the only intervention demonstrating robust evidence for improving survival times and slowing disease progression. The purpose of this article is to review the available literature supporting criteria currently used to diagnose non-azotaemic CKD and evidence for early intervention, with a focus on dietary modification.",

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate circulating amino acid levels in normal physiology is of critical importance. Evidence indicates that in healthy mammals, post-absorptive circulating levels of essential amino acids are maintained within a range that varies little from day to day or following bidirectional changes in dietary protein intake. This suggests the presence of homeostatic control mechanisms. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for the homeostatic regulation of essential amino acid availability, emphasizing the role of the brain in generating feedback controls to restore baseline levels acutely after a meal and during chronic changes in dietary protein intake. We review current evidence supporting brain amino acid sensing as a component of this regulatory system, integrating peripheral and central signals to modulate dietary protein intake and peripheral amino acid metabolism. We highlight major knowledge gaps regarding the specific neural circuits, molecular mechanisms and physiological outcomes of brain amino acid sensing. Future inquiry using the proposed framework and addressing these gaps will significantly enhance our understanding of the pathways involved in the maintenance of circulating amino acid availability and the regulation of lean mass in health, disease states or in response to therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.",

However, the ecological factors shaping A. baumannii gut colonization remain unclear. We show that A. baumannii and other pathogenic Acinetobacter evolved to utilize the amino acid ornithine, a non-preferred carbon source, to compete with resident microbiota and persist in the gut in mice. A. baumannii encodes ornithine succinyltransferase (AstO) necessary for catabolizing ornithine, especially in conditions of increased microbial diversity. Supplemental dietary ornithine promotes long-term fecal shedding of A. baumannii. By contrast, supplementation of preferred carbon sources-monosodium glutamate or histidine-abolishes the requirement for ornithine catabolism. Additionally, A. baumannii gut carriage is higher in formula-fed human infants, who generally consume higher levels of protein, revealing dietary impacts on Acinetobacter colonization. Together, these results reveal that ornithine catabolism facilitates A. baumannii colonization, providing a reservoir for pathogen spread.",

A crucial catalytic step is conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to phosphatidylethanolamine, driven by direct binding of the E2-like enzyme autophagy-related protein 3 (ATG3) to the ubiquitin-like protein autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12). Disrupting this ATG12-ATG3 protein-protein interaction (PPI) could silence both the degradative and secretory arms of autophagy with high pathway selectivity. Here we review the rapid evolution of ATG12-ATG3 inhibition from structural insight to drug-like chemical matter. High-resolution crystallography pinpointed a hydrophobic pocket around ATG12 Trp73 that accommodates ATG3 Met157, revealing an \"anchor-and-latch\"-a motif in which one residue ('anchor') buries deeply while flanking residues ('latch') secure the complex- topology ideal for small-molecule competition.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) has attracted more attentions by modulating G protein-coupled receptors and blood pressure. However, it remains unknown whether renal Mas receptor is regulated by GRK4 and its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) exhibited impaired Mas receptor-mediated diuresis and natriuresis, which was accompanied with increased phosphorylation levels of Mas receptors. Similarly, the phosphorylation of renal Mas receptor was increased and its-induced renal effects were decreased in human (h) GRK4γ 142V transgenic mice relative to wild-type littermates. There was a colocalization and a direct interaction of renal Mas receptor and GRK4, which were increased in SHRs and confirmed by rigid protein-protein docking. In vitro studies found that treatment with the Mas receptor agonist AVE0991 inhibited Na+-K+-ATPase activity in WKY renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells, which was failed in SHR cells. GRK4 silencing decreased the phosphorylation of Mas receptor and improved the impaired Mas receptor-mediated inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity in SHR RPT cells. Further study showed that ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction-targeted renal GRK4 depletion decreased Mas receptor phosphorylation and improved its-induced diuresis and natriuresis in SHRs. These suggest that GRK4 contributes to increased renal Mas receptor phosphorylation and dysfunction in hypertension, indicating that targeting GRK4 may be a viable therapeutic approach for hypertension.",

To address these challenges, this study developed a streamlined engineering strategy by systematically investigating the osmotic stress response mechanisms of Yarrowia lipolytica CA20 during erythritol fermentation and identifying key genetic determinants of cell growth and erythritol biosynthesis. Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses revealed that nucleotide, lipid, amino acid, cofactor, and vitamin metabolism were essential for osmotic adaptation, which was experimentally validated through targeted gene overexpression. Interestingly, while these modifications improved cell viability, they did not consistently enhance erythritol production. Further, genes A000169 and A004467, coding for a hypothetical protein and a GPR1/FUN34/YaaH family protein, respectively, were shown to be closely associated with erythritol production. Overexpression of A000169 combined with deletion of A004467 and EYD1 generated a robust strain, Yarrowia lipolytica EG01, capable of producing erythritol with a maximum titer of 218.70 g/L and a productivity of 2.27 g/L/h, with an increase of 62.96% relative to the original strain CA20, exceeding previously reported production levels of erythritol in Y. lipolytica using batch fermentation. Finally, two-stage fed-batch fermentation could achieve erythritol titer and yield up to 276.70 g/L and 0.69 g/g within 132 h. Overall, these findings provide valuable clues to the engineering of Y. lipolytica capable of efficient production of erythritol.",

    "combined_text": "C-reactive Protein/Albumin Ratio as a Prognostic Indicator for Predicting Surgical Intervention in Neonates With Necrotizing Enterocolitis: A Prospective Cohort Study.\n\nBackground Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major cause of neonatal gastrointestinal morbidity and mortality. Early prediction of the need for surgical intervention remains challenging due to reliance on late clinical or radiological signs. The C-reactive protein and albumin ratio (CRP/Albumin), reflecting both inflammation and nutritional status, may serve as a dynamic biomarker to guide timely surgical decision-making.  Objective The main objective of this study is to evaluate the prognostic utility of the CRP/Albumin ratio, and its temporal progression over the first three days of illness, in predicting surgical intervention and mortality in neonates. Methods In this prospective cohort study at a tertiary care hospital, Lahore, 66 neonates diagnosed with Bell's Stage I-IIIa NEC were enrolled over a year. CRP and albumin levels were measured daily for three consecutive days, and the CRP/Albumin ratio was calculated. Patients were grouped into progression trends: decreasing, increasing, stable, or variable. Outcomes included surgical intervention and mortality. Statistical analysis included receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and comparative group analysis.  Results Among 66 neonates (mean gestational age: 37.2 ± 3.2 weeks), 42.4% required surgery. Neonates with an increasing CRP/Albumin ratio trend had a significantly higher rate of surgical intervention (89.5%) and mortality (26.3%) compared to those with a decreasing trend (8.1% surgery and 2.6% mortality) (p < 0.001). The CRP/Albumin ratio demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy for surgery, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.926, 0.954, and 0.959 on Days 1-3, respectively. Optimal cut-offs on Days 2 and 3 yielded sensitivities and specificities above 85%. Serial monitoring of the ratio outperformed single-time-point measurements in prognostic value.  Conclusions CRP/Albumin is a simple, reliable, and cost-effective biomarker that can lead to early identification of neonates at risk of surgical intervention and poor outcomes in NEC. Monitoring its temporal progression, rather than relying on single measurements, appears to enhance its predictive accuracy and may support timely decision-making in clinical settings.",

    "combined_text": "Comparison of Zinc Levels in Liver Cirrhosis and Evaluating the Severity Using Child-Pugh Score.\n\nIntroduction Liver cirrhosis represents the final common pathway for chronic liver diseases, characterized by extensive fibrosis and hepatocyte dysfunction. Zinc, an essential micronutrient with critical roles in protein synthesis, enzymatic reactions, and antioxidant defense, has been implicated in liver pathophysiology. This study aimed to evaluate serum zinc levels in patients with liver cirrhosis and correlate them with disease severity as measured by the Child-Pugh classification. Methods This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 85 patients with liver cirrhosis attending the outpatient and inpatient departments of BLDE University's Shri BM Patil Medical College Hospital. Clinical evaluation and biochemical investigations were performed, including serum zinc levels and Child-Pugh scoring. Zinc deficiency is defined as serum levels below 51 μg/dL. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess relationships between variables. Results The study cohort comprised predominantly middle-aged men (95.3%), with alcoholic etiology (n=76, 89.4%) being the leading cause of cirrhosis. Advanced disease was common, with 67.1% of patients categorized as Child-Pugh Class C. Zinc deficiency was observed in 97.6% (n=83) of patients, with mean zinc levels showing a significant progressive decrease from Child-Pugh Class A (50.4±4.31 μg/dL) to Class B (42.32±4.86 μg/dL) to Class C (37.02±3.68 μg/dL) (p<0.001). There was a perfect parallelism between zinc and albumin deficiency (n=83, 97.6%). The mortality rate during the study period was 15.3% (n=13). Conclusion This study reveals a markedly high prevalence of zinc deficiency among patients with liver cirrhosis and establishes a significant inverse correlation between serum zinc levels and disease severity. The observed progressive decline in zinc concentrations with advancing Child-Pugh scores indicates that zinc deficiency may function both as a clinical marker of disease progression and as a contributing factor to hepatic deterioration. These findings highlight the potential value of incorporating routine zinc assessment in the evaluation of cirrhotic patients. Moreover, zinc supplementation may be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy, particularly in those with advanced-stage disease.",

Subsequently, cashew nut oligopeptides (COPs) were obtained via a two-step enzymatic hydrolysis involving alkaline proteinase and bromelain. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a specific COP with the sequence Ile-Ile-Ala-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gly-Val-Ala-His. This COP was synthesised to investigate its impact on preventing degranulation. Analysis revealed that COP effectively inhibited the release and production of proinflammatory mediators, including tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, histamine and β-hexosaminidase and influx of extracellular calcium ions. Furthermore, COP significantly suppressed degranulation and inflammatory responses by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor kappa B signalling pathway in allergic mast cells. These findings suggest that COP possesses strong anti-allergic effects by specifically targeting mast cells degranulation.

This quality of altering its concentration according to the immunological circumstances of the individuals, for example, in women, in which hormonal variables, nutritional states, and/or pregnancy, has led to think that one protein can be used as a biomarker in cancer, immunological diseases, and other pathologies. The aim of the present study was to determine the concentration of AGP1 protein in serum samples of apparently healthy women and to associate this concentration with several variables, such as age, body weight, and other physiological variables, that may affect the concentration of this protein. A total of 656 apparently healthy women were included according to their clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The determination of AGP1 concentration was performed by nephelometry in serum samples. The results show that the overall mean serum concentration of AGP1 was 76.82 ± 18.63 mg/dL (range 37.95-175 mg/dL).

Previous studies showed that the tight junction protein claudin 1 (CLDN1) is upregulated during tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced inflammation by capsaicin in keratinocytes in a transient receptor potential channel vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-dependent manner. However, the caveat with TRPV1 ligands is the undesired pain response elicited by the activation of neuronal TRPV1 channels. In this study, we hypothesized that also less or non-pungent homovanillic acid esters as structural analogs of capsaicin target CLDN1 upregulation during inflammation.\n\nWe aimed to identify beneficial structural characteristics by selecting homovanillic acid esters with different aliphatic tail structures and screening them for CLDN1 upregulation at early stages of TNFα-induced inflammation in basal keratinocytes.\n\nCLDN1 expression was upregulated independently of TRPV1 by compounds with a tail of 5 or 6 C-atoms, regardless of the presence of ramifications and double bonds with a maximum fold change of 2.05 ± 0.22 against control. The induction of CLDN1 expression was accompanied by increased expression of the differentiation marker involucrin (IVL).\n\nThe results suggest that the homovanillic ester-induced CLDN1 upregulation is a result of increased differentiation of the basal keratinocytes towards the keratinocyte morphology present in the stratum granulosum (SG), where tight junctions are formed. In conclusion, homovanillic acid esters with a 5 or 6 C-atom long aliphatic chain induced CLDN1 expression, thereby stimulating keratinocyte differentiation, independent from TRPV1 activation.",

The results of the study showed that after the intervention, the FRAIL score and APACHE II score were reduced more significantly in the observation group (P<0.05). In addition, vital signs improved more significantly in the observation group. After the intervention, all inflammatory factors in the observation group were lower than those in the control group, while nutritional proteins were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). In addition, oxidative stress injury was also more favorable in the observation group than in the control group after the intervention.

The aim of this study was thus to investigate the effect of obesogenic diets, obesity itself, and other variables, including mouse vendor, microbiota composition, and sex, on intestinal AMP expression. By using different dietary interventions in mice, we here show that prolonged intake of an obesogenic Western-style diet had a stronger impact on AMP expression than diet-independent obesity. Additionally, when comparing AMP expression under different diets in mice of both sexes from different vendors, the combined contribution of these factors had the strongest impact on absolute AMP transcript numbers, but also on the variability in small intestinal microbiota composition at the mucosa and content.

The results revealed that increasing MLPP levels led to a reduction in moisture content while significantly enhancing protein and ash content (p < 0.05). The pH values increased with higher MLPP concentrations, indicating its alkaline nature. Color analysis demonstrated a decline in brightness (L*) and redness (a*) due to the dark pigment of MLPP, while chroma and hue values exhibited fluctuations over storage. Cooking loss and diameter reduction decreased with MLPP incorporation, suggesting improved fat binding and water retention. Protein oxidation, measured by carbonyl content, was lower in MLPP-containing samples, implying enhanced protein stability. However, lipid oxidation, assessed via TBARS values, increased with higher MLPP levels, likely due to oxidative stress in locust fat. In vitro protein digestibility analysis indicated that MLPP improved digestibility, with the 20% substitution showing the highest values. These findings highlight the potential of MLPP as a functional ingredient in meat products, enhancing protein content and digestibility while influencing physicochemical properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that locust protein powder can be used as a sustainable and nutritious ingredient in meat products, such as emulsified chicken meatballs. Its incorporation improves protein content while maintaining desirable texture and oxidative stability, making it a viable option for the food industry. This could help manufacturers develop high-protein, eco-friendly alternatives for health-conscious consumers and support sustainable protein sources to reduce reliance on traditional livestock.",

While estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remains the gold standard for evaluating renal filtration capacity, its limitations in identifying early metabolic-driven dysfunction necessitate complementary biomarkers. The cardiometabolic index (CMI), reflects metabolic dysregulation but its link to eGFR-defined renal impairment remains unstudied. In this cross-sectional analysis of 13,696 U.S. adults (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2018), eGFR was calculated using the 2021 CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m² indicating reduced renal function). CMI, integrating triglyceride-to- high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Weighted multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates assessed CMI-eGFR associations. Restricted cubic spline and threshold analyses explored nonlinear relationships, while subgroup analyses tested consistency across populations. Higher CMI quintiles showed a dose-dependent increase in reduced eGFR prevalence (Q1: 5.3% vs Q5: 23.8%, P < .001). Fully adjusted models revealed 2.16-fold elevated odds of reduced eGFR in the highest CMI quintile (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27-3.69) versus the lowest. Restricted cubic spline analysis identified a nonlinear threshold effect at CMI = 0.182: below this threshold, each 1-unit CMI increase raised eGFR risk by 86% (95% CI = 1.49-2.23; P = .045), while above it, risk increased by 33% (95% CI = 1.11-1.59; P = .002). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent associations in females, nondiabetics, and older adults (all P < .05), with no significant interactions. Elevated CMI independently predicts reduced renal function, underscoring its utility as a metabolic biomarker for early CKD detection. The identified threshold (CMI ≥ 0.182) highlights a critical inflection point for clinical risk stratification, advocating CMI integration into routine screening to guide preventive strategies against metabolic-driven renal impairment.",

While dietary factors are known to influence bone health, the causal role of specific macronutrients-particularly carbohydrates-remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the causal effect of carbohydrate intake on BMD and to identify plasma metabolites that may mediate this association. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association study summary data from large-scale cohorts. Genetic variants associated with carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake were used as instrumental variables to evaluate their effects on total BMD. To investigate potential mediators, we performed two-step MR mediation analysis to identify plasma metabolites underlying the carbohydrate-BMD relationship. Pleiotropy and heterogeneity were assessed using MR-Egger regression and weighted median approaches. Genetically predicted carbohydrate intake was significantly associated with lower total BMD (odds ratio = 0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.98, P = .021), while no causal effects were observed for fat or protein intake. Mediation analysis identified 3 plasma metabolites-mannose-to-trans-4-hydroxyproline ratio, caffeine-to-theobromine ratio, and mannonate-as significant intermediaries. These metabolites jointly explained up to 27% of the total effect, suggesting that metabolic pathways related to mannose and caffeine may contribute to carbohydrate-induced bone loss. Our findings provide genetic evidence that carbohydrate intake adversely affects BMD through specific metabolic intermediates.

However, the limited genomic information on indigenous proso millet hinders its full utilization. This study addresses this gap by compiling chloroplast genome (cp. genome) data for the native variety ATL1 and its mutant derivative TNPmPEM 001, aiming to facilitate the development of new varieties.\n\nBoth Panicum miliaceum cv. ATL1 and TNPmPEM 001 chloroplast genomes exhibited the characteristic quadripartite structure. While they shared identical total lengths (139 837 bp), small single-copy (SSC: 12 795 bp), large single-copy (LSC: 84 522 bp), and inverted repeat (IR: 20 560 bp) regions, these metrics diverged from the reference genome, which displayed a total length of 139 826 bp, with distinct SSC (12 574 bp), LSC (81 682 bp), and IR (22 785 bp) regions. While soybean, cotton, sunflower, and pea constituted outgroups, the phylogenetic analysis showed a tight link between ATL1, TNPmPEM 001 and reference cp. genome as well as with little millet.

We hypothesize that agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARH) promote the consumption of rewarding stimuli under calorie restriction, independent of caloric content. To test this, we study mice fed 40% of their average daily intake and exposed daily to the non-caloric sweetener saccharin before feeding. We show that calorie-restricted (CR) mice increase saccharin intake before each restricted feeding event and that this response requires ARH integrity. CR mice exhibit activation of AgRP neurons and their brain targets without significant changes in AgRP fiber density. Furthermore, satiated mice increase saccharin intake following chemogenetic activation of AgRP neurons, whereas CR mice with selective chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons show reduced saccharin intake. Thus, we conclude that AgRP neuron activation enhances the consumption of a purely rewarding stimulus in CR mice. These findings contribute to our understanding of how the brain shapes food choices under conditions of energy deficit and could be important for managing food consumption during dieting or in eating disorders.",

After correcting for covariates, the highest AGP quartile (≥ 0.950 g/L) was associated with a 1.72-fold higher risk of gallstones compared to the lowest quartile (≤ 0.629 g/L) (OR = 2.72,95% CI: 1.31-5.65; p = 0.014). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations in non-Hispanic whites, low-income individuals, and smokers. SUA partially mediated the AGP-gallstone relationship, accounting for 14.76% of the total effect. This study found that AGP levels were significantly associated with gallstone risk in US adult women, and serum uric acid played a mediating role. Future research should further investigate the causal relationship and its applicability in different populations.",

Studies regarding the physical development usually cover a short period of time, do not include dietary information, and results are contradictory. The aim of this study is to determine whether the patients with PKU have a normal growth, the incidence of obesity and the relationship of these parameters with diet and nutritional intake.\n\nThis is a retrospective, multicenter, multinational study including patients with PKU from 8 centers from different countries. Data of growth parameters and dietary regimes were collected from birth until the age of 18 years. Anthropometric tools of the WHO (Anthro version 3.2.2 and Anthro plus) were used to calculate z-score for weight-for-age, height-for-age and body mass index (BMI).\n\nData from 182 patients with classical PKU were included. The median height z-scores for both male and female patients showed a normal growth pattern according to the WHO charts. Significant positive correlation  was observed between height z-score and the Phe (mg/day) and natural protein (g/day) intakes in all ages, especially in children younger than 11 years. The amount of Phe-free amino acid mixture did not affect the height, but lower intakes were negative correlated with the BMI. Also, we detected a positive correlation between the median Phe levels and BMI, meaning that the poorer metabolic control was correlated with higher BMI.\n\nAn objective of PKU is that patients have satisfactory final physical development; the height prognosis seems to be associated with Phe and natural protein intake and therefore should be optimized. It is important to collect longitudinal growth data throughout childhood and adolescence in PKU that considers any change in growth in relationship to dietary patterns.",

While dominant phyla such as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes have been extensively studied at the phylum level, the immunomodulatory roles of specific members within these groups particularly the abundant but mechanistically underexplored Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (a member of Firmicutes) and Akkermansia muciniphila (of Verrucomicrobia) remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, current literature primarily focuses on associative findings, and integrated analyses elucidating disease-specific mechanisms and therapeutic relevance are still lacking. In this review, we synthesize mechanistic and disease-specific evidence regarding these two bacterial species across six autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). F. prausnitzii is consistently depleted in autoimmune contexts and exerts protective effects through multiple mechanisms, including short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, Treg induction, secretion of microbial anti-inflammatory molecules (MAM), enhancement of epithelial barrier integrity, and modulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. In contrast, A. muciniphila modulates mucosal immunity via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activation and tight junction enhancement but exhibits more variable patterns depending on disease and host context. This review offers an integrative framework comparing how these two taxa influence shared immune pathways such as the Th17/Treg axis, SCFA-G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) signaling, and epithelial barrier modulation across distinct autoimmune phenotypes. We also discuss therapeutic implications, including their roles as next-generation probiotics and the translational challenges of clinical application. By focusing on two mechanistically distinct but clinically relevant microbes, this review bridges current knowledge gaps and highlights promising directions for precision microbiome interventions in autoimmune diseases.",

Obesity-associated increases in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) have been linked to lipotoxicity. In this study, patients with secondary lymphedema showed a significantly lower plasma polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid (PUFA/SFA) ratio compared to BMI-matched controls. Stearic acid, a common dietary SFA, induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human lymphatic endothelial cells. In a mouse model, a short-term high-SFA diet was used to lower the plasma PUFA/SFA ratio, which worsened tail swelling, oxidative stress, ER stress, and tissue damage following lymphatic injury. Switching to a standard chow diet after surgery prevented these effects. Patients with lymphedema also exhibited elevated levels of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), a lipid chaperone associated with metabolic stress. FABP4 inhibition reduced stearic acid-induced cell death in vitro and mitigated tissue damage in vivo. These findings suggest a pathogenic role for SFAs and support dietary modulation and FABP4 inhibition as potential therapeutic strategies for lymphedema.",

To uncover the influencing molecular signature defining ischaemic cardiomyopathy with diabetes, we performed multi-omic analyses of ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy with and without diabetes against healthy age-matched donors. Tissue was sourced from pre-mortem human left ventricular myocardium. Fatty acid transport and oxidation proteins were most downregulated in ischaemic cardiomyopathy with diabetes relative to donors. However, the downregulation of acylcarnitines, perilipin, and ketone body, amino acid, and glucose metabolising proteins indicated lipid metabolism may not be entirely impaired. Oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, myofibrosis, and cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture also appeared exacerbated principally in ischaemic cardiomyopathy with diabetes. These findings indicate that diabetes confounds the pathological phenotype in heart failure, and the need for a paradigm shift regarding lipid metabolism.",

We here show the expression of OLFM2 to be adipocyte-specific and inversely associated with obesity. OLFM2 levels increase during adipogenesis and are suppressed in inflamed adipocytes. Functionally, OLFM2 deficiency impairs adipocyte differentiation, while its over-production enhances the adipogenic transformation of fat cell progenitors. Loss and gain of function experiments revealed that OLFM2 modulates key metabolic and structural pathways, including PPAR signaling, citrate cycle, fatty acid degradation, axon guidance and focal adhesion in 3T3 cell lines and primary human adipocytes. On the molecular level, OLFM2 deficiency in differentiated adipocytes predominantly downregulates genes involved in cell cycle. Extending these findings in vivo, both whole-body Olfm2 knockout and adipose-specific Olfm2 depletion in mice resulted in impaired adipose cell cycle gene expression, with the latter also displaying fat mass accretion and metabolic dysfunction. Collectively, our results underscore a critical role for OLFM2 in adipocyte biology, and support a causative link between reduced adipose OLFM2 and the pathophysiology of obesity.",

Here, we show that hypoxia induces casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated glucokinase (GCK) S398 phosphorylation, which exposes its nuclear localization signal (NLS) for importin α1 binding and nuclear translocation. Importantly, nuclear GCK interacts with the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and functions as a protein kinase that phosphorylates TAZ T346. Phosphorylated TAZ recruits peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) for cis-trans isomerization of TAZ, which inhibits the binding of β-TrCP to TAZ and β-TrCP-mediated TAZ degradation. Activated TAZ-TEAD induces the expression of downstream target genes to promote tumour growth. These findings reveal an instrumental mechanism by which a glycolytic enzyme regulates the Hippo pathway under hypoxic conditions and highlight the moonlighting function of GCK as a protein kinase in modulating TAZ activity and tumour growth.",

This paper examines strategies to address inefficiencies in meat production, including high resource use and environmental impacts, by utilising low-value feedstuffs, agricultural by-products, and innovative supplements. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, synthesising recent research from databases such as Scopus and Web of Science, focusing on forage-based diets, grain supplements, marine-derived additives, agrifood by-products, and micronutrient interventions. Findings reveal that forage-based diets enhance health-enhancing fatty acids in ruminant meat, while marine supplements like Asparagopsis seaweed may reduce methane emissions without compromising meat safety. Agricultural by-products, such as grape pomace and olive cake, improve oxidative stability and fatty acid profiles, aligning with circular economy principles. Mineral and vitamin supplementation, including selenium and vitamin E, boosts antioxidative capacity, extending meat shelf life and retail storage quality. However, outcomes depend on feed type, inclusion levels, and animal species, with antinutritional factors requiring careful management to avoid metabolic disorders. The review concludes that integrating diverse feed resources, such as forages, marine additives, and by-products, can enhance sustainability, reduce environmental footprints, and improve meat quality. Strategic implementation of these practices, tailored to regional feed availability and livestock needs, is critical for balancing economic viability, ecological resilience, and nutritional enhancement in future food systems.",

In our previous work, we demonstrated that integrating sequence variant information with structural analysis can enhance the prediction of true functional SLiMs while simultaneously generating tolerance matrices that indicate whether each of the 19 possible single amino acid substitutions (SASs) is tolerated. However, the scarcity of representative crystallographic structures of SLiM-receptor complexes posed a significant limitation.

These AF2-derived structures show robust performance, both in reproducing known structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and in reflecting the deleterious effects of known sequence variants. This updated version of MotSASi expands the repertoire of high-confidence predicted SLiMs and provides a comprehensive catalog of variants located within SLiMs, along with their respective deleteriousness assessments. When compared to AlphaMissense, MotSASi demonstrates superior performance in predicting variant deleteriousness.

Its ability to survive in harsh environments and evade antibiotic treatments underscores the urgent need for new therapeutic targets. Emerging evidence suggests that the small protein B (SmpB) may also play broader roles in bacterial virulence, including regulation of biofilm formation, motility, and stress adaptation. However, the specific contributions of SmpB to these pathogenic traits in A. baumannii remain poorly defined. Addressing this knowledge gap is essential for evaluating SmpB as a potential antimicrobial target and developing new strategies to combat multidrug-resistant infections.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing was used to generate a targeted smpB mutant in A. baumannii. The smpB mutant was assessed for growth, biofilm formation, motility, antibiotic susceptibility, and virulence. Biofilm was quantified via crystal violet staining and microscopy, while motility was examined using swimming, swarming, and twitching assays. Antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated using disk diffusion. Virulence was tested in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify changes in protein expression associated with smpB disruption.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing successfully introduced a C212T nucleotide substitution in the smpB gene, resulting in an A89G amino acid change. Growth curve analysis showed no significant difference between the wild-type and smpB mutant strains under nutrient-rich conditions. However, the mutant exhibited a significant reduction in biofilm formation (p = 0.0079) and impaired twitching motility, while swimming and swarming motility remained unaffected. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed increased sensitivity to ceftizoxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin, alongside decreased susceptibility to cefepime, tetracycline, and spectinomycin. In the G. mellonella infection model, the smpB mutant showed reduced virulence, with 84% larval survival compared to 72% in the wild type (p = 0.4183). Proteomic analysis revealed downregulation of key stress response and virulence-associated proteins, including GroEL, DnaK, RecA, and PirA, while proteins involved in ribosome maturation and transcription, such as RimP and RpoA, were upregulated. STRING network analysis supported the broad regulatory role of SmpB in biofilm formation, motility, stress adaptation, and pathogenesis.\n\nThis study demonstrates that SmpB is a key regulator of biofilm formation, twitching motility, antibiotic response, and virulence in A. baumannii. While not essential for growth under optimal conditions, smpB disruption impairs multiple pathogenic traits and alters stress-related proteomic pathways. These findings highlight the potential of SmpB as a novel antimicrobial target, offering a promising strategy to weaken bacterial virulence without promoting resistance. Targeting the trans-translation system may pave the way for innovative therapies against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.",

The role of the extracellular matrix regulator REversion Inducing Cysteine Rich Protein With Kazal Motifs (RECK) in metabolic liver disease is poorly understood. We previously reported that RECK gain-of-function, specifically in hepatocytes, protects against diet-induced MASH. Here, we hypothesized that hepatocyte-specific RECK loss-of-function exacerbates liver injury in a pre-clinical model of diet-induced MASH. Using two novel mouse models of hepatocyte-specific RECK depletion, we demonstrate that RECK gene deletion significantly increased inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis in the liver. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis supported these findings, revealing gene/protein networks associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Targeted assessment revealed that RECK depletion results in elevated hepatic mRNA levels of several genes associated with inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrogenesis. Further, levels of phosphorylated EGFR and its ligand amphiregulin (AREG) were also increased with RECK germline deletion, suggesting a potential link between RECK and EGFR activity. These studies reveal RECK as a critical regulator of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and highlight its potential as a novel therapeutic in MASH.",

    "combined_text": "Ecolabels and the Healthfulness and Carbon Footprint of Restaurant Meal Selections: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\n\nRestaurants are increasingly interested in capitalizing on consumer interest in environmental sustainability by marketing their products with ecolabels, which signal when foods are more environmentally sustainable. Ecolabels could improve the healthfulness of restaurant meal selections and reduce their carbon footprint, but this potential remains largely untested.\n\nTo test whether displaying ecolabels on restaurant menus improves the healthfulness and reduces the carbon footprint of restaurant meal selections.\n\nThis randomized clinical trial was conducted online in September to October 2024. A national sample of US adults (aged ≥18 years) was recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to the ecolabel or control arm. Participants viewed a restaurant menu mimicking a popular full-service restaurant and selected items they wanted to order. Statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle.\n\nIn the ecolabel arm, participants viewed a menu that displayed ecolabels next to entrées and appetizers with a lower carbon footprint (ie, below the median of 1.625 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent [CO2e] emissions per item). In the control arm, participants viewed a menu that did not display ecolabels.\n\nThe outcomes included overall healthfulness (assessed using Ofcom Nutrient Profiling Model scores; range: 0-100, with higher scores indicating healthier items), nutrient content, and total carbon footprint of participants' entrée and appetizer selections and entire orders (including beverages and desserts).\n\nA total of 3147 participants completed the online trial (1560 men [50%]; mean [SD] age, 34.5 [12.5] years). Participants in the ecolabel arm did not select entrées and appetizers (average differential effect [ADE], 0.45 [95% CI, -0.18 to 1.09]; P = .16; Cohen d = 0.05) or entire orders (ADE, 0.47 [95% CI, -0.09 to 1.03]; P = .10; Cohen d = 0.06) that were statistically significantly healthier compared with the selections of participants in the control arm. Participants in the ecolabel arm selected entrées and appetizers (ADE, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.12-1.62] g; P = .02; Cohen d = 0.08) and entire orders (ADE, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.07-1.56] g; P = .03; Cohen d = 0.08) with more fiber, compared with the selections of participants in the control arm, but did not select entrées and appetizers or entire orders with statistically significantly different amounts of protein, sugar, saturated fat, or calorie content. Participants in the ecolabel arm selected entrées and appetizers (ADE, -0.78 [95% CI, -1.25 to -0.32] kg of CO2e emissions; P < .001; Cohen d = -0.12) and entire orders (ADE, -0.81 [95% CI, -1.27 to -0.34] kg of CO2e emissions; P < .001; Cohen d = -0.12) with lower carbon footprints than the selections of participants in the control arm.\n\nIn this randomized clinical trial, menu ecolabels reduced the carbon footprint of restaurant meal selections without worsening nutritional quality. Ecolabels could be a scalable, low-cost strategy to reduce the carbon emissions of restaurant food choices.\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06584539.",

The study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of rosuvastatin and/or vitamin K on VC in a rat model of adenine-induced CKD and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Forty Wistar albino rats were divided equally into five groups: rats of group I (control group) received drug vehicle, rats of group ΙΙ received an adenine containing diet, rats of group IIİ received an adenine-containing diet + oral rosuvastatin (5 mg/kg/day), rats of group ΙV received an adenine-containing diet + oral vitamin K (40 mg/kg/day) and rats of group V received adenine containing diet and combined treatment of rousvastatin and vitamin K.

Oxidative stress and inflammation markers were measured in kidney and aortic homogenates, whereas alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin and bone morphogenic protein-2 levels and autophagic markers were measured in aortic hemogenates. Treatment with rosuvastatin and/ or vitamin K improved renal function and decreased aortic calcium accumulation. Additionally, they decreased ALP activity and osteogenic markers level while increasing the expression of autophagic markers. The beneficial effects of rosuvastatin and/ or vitamin K are further supported by histopathological examination of aortas and kidneys.

The proposed nutritional bioenergetics model is based on the dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory, a mechanistic framework to study individual metabolism. The model is an extension of the typical DEB models in that it includes a digestion module where the protein and non-protein food components contribute to assimilation via the concept of a synthesising unit (SU). The model allows predictions for measurable quantities of interest for aquaculture, including feeding rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide, ammonia and solid waste production, under various temperatures and feeding conditions, both in terms of quantity and macronutrient composition. The feeding schedule's effects, such as the diurnal variation in waste production in response to feeding frequency, are also captured. The model quantifies the effects of the dietary protein-to-energy ratio on food intake and assimilation; energy-rich diets or those with excessive or poor amounts of protein show reduced intake.

The C-Reactive Protein to Albumin Ratio (CAR), an emerging biomarker reflecting systemic inflammation and nutritional status, has demonstrated prognostic value in various diseases. However, its utility in predicting clinical outcomes in RA patients remains underexplored, warranting further investigation to assess its potential role in disease management and prognosis. This cross-sectional study investigates the potential relationship between CAR and RA in United States adults, develops a clinical prediction model, and validates its effectiveness.\n\nTo investigate the association between the CAR and RA using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\n\nThis large-scale, cross-sectional study analyzed data from the NHANES database between 1999 and 2018 (excluding 2011-2014). The CAR was calculated as the ratio of C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin (ALB) levels. RA status was identified through self-reported questionnaire data. Weighted multivariate regression models and subgroup analyses were used to examine the association between CAR and RA. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to evaluate potential non-linear relationships, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were utilized for variable selection in the prediction model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were applied to assess the predictive performance of the models.\n\nThis study included a total of 20,733 patients, among whom 1,744 individuals (4.95%) were diagnosed with RA. After controlling for all covariates, the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated a statistically significant correlation between higher Ln(CAR) levels and the increased incidence of RA (OR:1.77 (95% CI, 1.39-2.25);\n\nThese findings suggest that CAR may serve as a promising inflammatory biomarker for predicting the presence of RA. In the RA prediction model incorporating CAR, we validated the effectiveness and clinical utility of this model, providing evidence that CAR can serve as a biomarker for RA risk prediction. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate its clinical utility in RA risk stratification and management.",

    "combined_text": "An Apple Susceptibility-Related LRR Receptor-Like Kinase MdRLKT21 Activates Plant Immunity by Hijacking a Trans-Kingdom Fungal microRNA-Like RNA.\n\nFungal small RNAs (sRNAs) represent a novel class of effector molecules in plant-pathogen interactions. However, understanding of how plants counteract fungal sRNAs-mediated trans-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) in plant immunity remains limited. In previous study, a milRNA (Vm-milR1) from Valsa mali can be found to transboundary inhibit the expression of disease-resistance genes MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2 in apple. In this study, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase MdRLKT21 is isolated and characterized, and is confirmed to play a negative regulatory role in the basal immune response. Importantly, MdRLKT21 could hijack Vm-milR1 to rescue the suppression of MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2, and a similar phenomenon is also observed in the interaction between V. mali and pear trees. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that MdRLKT21 can interact with and phosphorylate a C3HC4-type RING finger protein MdRFP1, which positively regulates the apple resistance to V. mali infection. What's more, it is found that MdRLKT21 could inhibit the MdRFP1-mediated immune response, probably by promoting the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of MdRFP1 in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Taken together, it is proposed that an apple susceptibility-related LRR-RLK competitively binds to fungal sRNA effector and subsequently activates defenses by salvaging the expression of MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2 and thereby releasing the resistance protein MdRFP1.",

    "combined_text": "SARITA: a large language model for generating the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 776 million infections and 7 million deaths globally between December 2019 and November 2024. Since the emergence of the original Wuhan strain, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into multiple variants-including Alpha, Delta, and Omicron-primarily through mutations in the Spike glycoprotein. The S1 subunit, which binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, mutates frequently and plays a key role in infectivity and immune escape, while the more conserved S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion. Anticipating future mutations is essential for guiding vaccine design and therapeutic strategies. Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in protein sequence modeling due to their capacity to produce realistic and functional synthetic sequences. Here, we introduce SARITA, a GPT-3-based LLM with up to 1.2 billion parameters, fine-tuned via continual learning on the protein model RITA trained on 107 017 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 Spike sequences (up to March 1st 2021) to generate high-quality synthetic SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunits.\n\nSARITA is able to generate realistic, full-length synthetic S1 subunits starting from a 14-amino-acid prompt. When evaluated on unseen sequences collected between March 2021 and November 2023-including major Variants of Concern (VOCs) such as Delta and Omicron, and Variants of Interest such as Iota-SARITA outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art LLMs in terms of sequence quality, biological plausibility, and similarity to real-world viral evolution. SARITA generates high-quality sequences in over 97% of cases, with markedly lower False Mutation Rate and higher similarity scores (PAM30, Levenshtein distance) compared to alternative approaches. It also accurately reproduces key mutations characteristic of future variants-such as L212I, R158L, T95P, and E406K-which were not present in the training data but emerged later in VOCs like Omicron and Delta. Structure-based analysis confirms the functional plausibility of these substitutions, with ΔΔG values within experimentally supported thresholds for ACE2 and antibody binding. Furthermore, SARITA anticipates immune-evasive mutations and accurately captures the positional and statistical distribution of mutations found in post- March 1st 2021 variants, highlighting its potential as a predictive tool for viral evolution.\n\nThese results indicate the potential of SARITA to predict future SARS-CoV-2 S1 evolution, potentially aiding in the development of adaptable vaccines and treatments.",

However, the specific role of LQ in alleviating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its correlated metabolic disorders remains to be further explored. This study aimed to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of LQ in modulating metabolic inflammation (meta-inflammation) and mainly focused on a systemic muscle-liver crosstalk mediated by myonectin. High-fat diet (HFD) male C57BL/6J mice were established to evaluate the effects of LQ on hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and secretion of myonectin. The effects of LQ and myonectin on meta-inflammation and the potential molecular mechanisms in vitro were assessed in C2C12 cells and HepG2 cells. In vivo findings indicated that LQ attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and meta-inflammation. LQ treatment downregulated the meta-inflammation-related protein expression levels of CD36 and TLR4, subsequently reducing the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), c-jun, and NF-κB. Administration of LQ was associated with reduced levels of myonectin. Myonectin and PA exhibited synergistic effects on enhancing protein expressions of the CD36/TLR4 pathway, whereas LQ attenuated the activation of these protein expressions. Additionally, a pretreatment with LPS eliminated the protective effects of LQ and restored the effects of PA and myonectin. The mechanisms of LQ on reducing meta-inflammation might be mediated by muscle-liver crosstalk signaling of myonectin, and the CD36/TLR4 signaling pathway was essential in modulating meta-inflammation by LQ. These findings demonstrated the role and mechanisms of LQ in alleviating meta-inflammation, which was mediated through muscle-liver crosstalk signals of myonectin and its downstream CD36/TLR4 pathway. The results would provide novel insights into the potential of LQ as a phytotherapy for NAFLD.",

    "combined_text": "Effects of Modification Technology on Soybean Protein Isolate: Physicochemical Characteristics, Protein Conformation, and Gel Properties.\n\nPlant-based protein products hold a crucial position in the food industry in response to the demand for sustainable development. The effects of pH-shifting, fibrillation treatment (SPF), and mild heating on the physicochemical characteristics, protein conformation, and gel properties of soy isolate protein (SPI) were studied. The result showed that pH-shifting induced a reduction of the smallest particle size from 323.18 to 156.21 nm and the largest total sulfhydryl from 78.56 to 98.45 µmol/g. Compared to the control, the viscosity increased and surface hydrophobicity decreased after modification treatments. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy suggested that the three modification methods significantly changed the secondary and tertiary structure of SPI. In addition, it was found that pH-shifting induced the gel to form a denser gel network structure with favorable gel strength (27.09 g), water holding capacity (98.65%), and thermostability, while SPF induced the gel network to form a loose structure. Thus, modification techniques, particularly pH-shifting, can be effectively employed to enhance the gel properties of SPI. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SPI is highly favored in the food industry due to its nutritional value and sustainability. However, its solubility is low due to its compact structure, which limits its application in the food industry. Modifying proteins with different methods to improve their functional properties holds great significance for the development of plant-based gel foods. This provides valuable insights into optimizing the performance of SPI gel products and promoting the growth of the sustainable plant-based food sector.",

CGRP, a 37 amino acid neuropeptide found throughout the body, plays a beneficial role in sepsis by reducing inflammatory cytokine release, inhibiting the oxidative stress pathway, and decreasing organ-specific inflammation. Research evidence on knockout mice states that specific receptor deficient mice [CGRP receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)] exhibited more pronounced neutrophil aggregation and inflammation compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that a CGRP agonism could be a promising treatment for sepsis.

As bone tissues are the supporting organ of the body, it remains unknown whether MC-LR interferes with adolescent growth and development by targeting bone tissue. In the present study, MC-LR accumulated in bones and caused increased loss of trabecular bone and incomplete bone microstructure, leading to bone retardation in adolescent mice. Moreover, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the bone marrow cavity of MC-LR-treated femurs led to the presence of massive numbers of senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which was responsible for enhanced adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs rather than osteogenic differentiation. MC-LR-treated BMSCs presented an obvious decrease in the expression of glutaminase (GLS), a key gene for glutamine metabolism, accompanied by a decrease in glutamate content and GSH synthesis, which was the main cause of ROS accumulation. Activation of GLS reversed MC-LR-induced BMSCs senescence by promoting glutamine metabolism and reducing ROS release. Moreover, transcriptome sequencing data from BMSCs exposed to MC-LR indicated that the Hippo pathway was enriched, and endogenous levels of Yes-associated protein (YAP) were markedly decreased under MC-LR exposure. The overexpression of YAP promoted GLS transcription by facilitating its promoter, which then reversed MC-LR-induced disturbance of glutamine metabolism and BMSCs senescence. After MC-LR exposure, decreased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity can activate the Hippo pathway. These findings suggest that MC-LR binds to and inhibits PP2A activity, causes activation of the Hippo pathway, blocks GLS-mediated glutamine metabolism, and accelerates BMSCs senescence, which is the key to delaying MC-LR-induced adolescent bone development retardation.",

    "combined_text": "E3 ubiquitin ligase OsATL32, targeted by the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t, undermines Piz-t-conferred immunity in rice.\n\nDuring pathogenic infection, fungi release numerous effectors to suppress host immunity. We previously revealed that the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase OsATL32 negatively regulates resistance against blast disease, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we report the function of OsATL32 in rice immune responses mediated by the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat containing receptor (NLR) protein Piz-t. The M. oryzae avirulence effector AvrPiz-t, a cognate of Piz-t, interacts with OsATL32, enhancing the ligase activity of OsATL32 toward its substrates, including the small GTPase OsRac5. OsATL32 targets Piz-t for ubiquitination, leading to the protein degradation of Piz-t through the 26S proteasome pathway and thus disrupts Piz-t-conferred blast resistance. AvrPiz-t competitively interferes the association of OsATL32 with the protein phosphatase OsPTEN, which dephosphorylates OsATL32 to promote its degradation. Moreover, OsATL32 displays higher affinity to AvrPiz-t than to Piz-t, leading to the dissociation of OsATL32 from Piz-t in the presence of AvrPiz-t. These observations revealed that OsATL32 keeps Piz-t in an inactive state through direct interaction and ubiquitination under normal growth conditions, whereas AvrPiz-t stabilizes OsATL32 and facilitates its E3 ligase activity in ubiquitinating the substrates, including the small GTPase OsRac5 for degradation upon infection by M. oryzae strains carrying an AvrPiz-t allele. Furthermore, AvrPiz-t prevents Piz-t from OsATL32-mediated ubiquitination, thus triggering Piz-t-conferred rice immunity. Our findings demonstrate that OsATL32 connects with AvrPiz-t and Piz-t to modulate Piz-t-conferred rice immunity.",

    "combined_text": "Turmeric bioactive compounds in poultry nutrition: current status and future prospects.\n\nSuccessful poultry producers aim to maximize their meat, egg, or offspring yields while also satisfying the quality expectations of consumers. Even when raised under controlled conditions, poultry are exposed to diverse stressors, such as the hatching process, transportation from hatcheries to farms, vaccination, presence of mycotoxins in feedstuffs, and transportation to slaughter houses, which can have unfavorable impacts on their immunity, productivity, reproductive performance, meat, egg yield, and quality. Curcumin (Cur) is a polyphenolic bioactive molecule found in turmeric, which is used as a natural feed additive in poultry production. The antioxidant characteristics of Cur are due to its chemical structure. Cur can improve the meat quality, such as the color and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents, as well as reducing the drip loss and malondialdehyde concentration in meat. Cur can enhance egg quality characteristics, such as the eggshell strength, yolk color, Haugh unit score, yolk contents of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and yolk Cur concentration. Serotonin secretion is stimulated by Cur, and it prevents heat shock protein 70 and corticosterone production in stressed poultry. Thus, Cur can boost immunity and the effectiveness of vaccinations, and decrease the likelihood of diseases. Therefore, Cur could be applied as an important feed additive and a suitable choice for poultry producers, but it is necessary to know how to select the most appropriate form and level of supplementation before adding Cur to the diets of poultry. The present review clearly describes the impacts of different Cur forms and concentrations of the active substance on poultry production, as well as considering its mode(s) of action. Clarifying the mode(s) of action for Cur could help to identify new uses for Cur that will require examination.",

Therapeutic incretin receptor agonists (RAs), such as tirzepatide, are widely used to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, incretin RAs are facing production challenges at present. Therefore, we engineered transgenic (tg) mice to secrete incretin RAs in milk, leveraging mammary gland bioreactors for cost-effective peptide production. The goat beta-casein promoter-driven constructs encoding tirzepatide-derived peptide linked to human IgG4 Fc via a (GGGGS)₃ spacer were used to produce tg mice. Founders tg-1 and tg-5 exhibited mammary-specific expression, yielding 0.8-1.42 g/l recombinant protein exclusively in milk. Progeny nursed by founders showed sustained hypoglycemia (10-39% reduction; p < 0.05) and marked weight loss (14-49%; p < 0.01) compared to wild-type controls, validating the bioactivity of milk-derived GLP-1/GIP RAs. Moreover, tg-5-nursed offspring experienced high mortality post-Day 16, likely due to overdosing. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the mammary gland bioreactor as a viable platform for incretin RAs production, circumventing complex synthesis and enabling scalable biologics manufacturing.",

Kopyor) is a distinct coconut variant resulting from a genetic mutation that alters the endosperm. Kopyor displays notable phenotypic diversity in terms of cultivar and endosperm quantity (EQ), which refers to the amount of flesh detached from the endocarp. Despite its distinct traits, kopyor utilization is limited because of the lack of comprehensive research on its diverse phenotypes. The aim of this study was to investigate the variations of metabolites and nutrients in kopyors by analyzing metabolomic profiles, physicochemical properties, and proximate characteristics across three cultivars with EQ levels ranging from 10 % to 50 %. The results showed that EQ influenced metabolite accumulation more significantly than the cultivar did. Elevated levels of EQ have been associated with increased concentrations of essential amino acids, which are classified as sensory-related metabolites. An increase in EQ was accompanied by the breakdown of macromolecules, particularly carbohydrates and proteins into simpler sugars and amino acids. This process potentially enhanced the bioavailability of nutrients in kopyor coconuts compared to that in normal coconuts. This study proposed potential metabolite marker for assessing the quality of kopyor coconuts. Valine, an essential amino acid, was the only compound consistently and significantly detected across all analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA), F-test, Tukey's test, Pearson correlation, and orthogonal projections to latent structures regression (OPLSR), conducted on the water and flesh of kopyor coconuts. Consequently, valine was identified as a promising biomarker candidate. This study is the first to extensively characterize the phenotypic diversity of kopyor.

However, its long-term use is limited by the fact that most treated patients develop painful polyneuropathy. In some of the treated patients, pain resolves with time; in others, it persists, with the underlying mechanisms poorly understood. One prerequisite for neural toxicity is the ability of a drug to penetrate the blood-nerve barrier.\n\nHere, we analysed the pathways involved in early BTZ-induced polyneuropathy development and its resolution in rats and in myeloma patients using pain behaviour, barrier analysis, transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and clinical data.\n\nOne cycle of BTZ elicited transient tactile and cold allodynia in rats. Transcriptomic signature and network analysis revealed regulation of circadian, extracellular matrix, and immune genes within the nerve and modest changes in the dorsal root ganglia. Recovery processes resealed the small molecule leakiness of the perineurial barrier, reversed axonal swelling, and normalised fibre density in the skin. Expression of the microtubule-associated cytoskeletal protein cortactin matched this process in the perineurium. Netrin-1 as a known barrier sealer was also upregulated in pain resolution in nerve and skin. In patients with painful BTZ-induced polyneuropathy, skin innervation was reduced and netrin-1 was unchanged, compatible with the persistence of pain.\n\nIn summary, our data demonstrate that early bortezomib toxicity targets mainly peripheral nerves and indicate that pain resolution could be supported by protective growth factors such as netrin-1 for remodelling of the extracellular matrix and neuronal barriers.\n\nDRKS00025422.",

Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that these targets are mainly enriched in neuroinflammation, synaptic signaling, and metabolic pathways. Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities for AD-related proteins, including translocator protein (TSPO), transcription factor c-Jun (JUN), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2).

In conclusion, DBP may contribute to AD development by affecting AD targets expression (TSPO, JUN, CDKN1A, and PTGS2) and modulating pathways associated with neuroinflammation and synaptic function, providing mechanistic insights on how environmental toxicants may influence neurodegenerative processes.",

Thirty female Holstein calves were enrolled. Newborn calves were fed ∼3.8 L of colostrum within 2 h of birth, followed by 1 to 1.5 L at 11.5 h postnatum. Calves were then assigned to receive either TM (6 L twice daily from dam) or milk replacer (MR; 6 L twice daily, 140 g/L) for 5 d, followed by feeding MR (12 L/d) via an automated system until weaning. Weaning was performed gradually from 8 to 14 wk. From d 14 onward, calves were group-housed in straw-bedded pens (up to 10 per pen) with access to solid feed. Blood samples were collected at different time points: 30 min after birth (before colostrum intake), 12 h after birth following colostrum intake, preweaning (wk 2, 6, and 10 of life), at weaning (wk 14), postweaning (mo 8), at insemination (13 mo), 3 wk before calving, at calving (average age of 26 ± 2.3 mo), and 3 wk after calving. Plasma samples were analyzed for AA, biogenic amines, and AA-related metabolites via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using the Biocrates MxP Quant 500 kit. Volcano plot analysis (P < 0.05, fold change ≥1.5) revealed that 21 plasma metabolites were changed after colostrum intake. Sixteen metabolites increased after colostrum, including essential AA (Met, Lys, Thr, Leu), α-aminoadipic acid, and serotonin, suggesting rapid protein digestion, systemic anabolic activation, and serotonergic stimulation. Five metabolites, including creatinine, Gly, phenylacetylglutamine, and hippuric acid, decreased significantly, suggesting reduced muscle breakdown and early modulation of microbial metabolism. Maturation of kidney function may have increased creatinine excretion. No treatment or treatment × time interaction effects were observed for any of the metabolites, indicating that TM feeding did not alter plasma metabolite profiles. In contrast, significant time effects and principal component analysis confirmed that developmental stage was the primary determinant of temporal variation in plasma metabolite composition. Amino acids, both essential (e.g., Met and Lys, peaking preweaning) and nonessential (e.g., Ala, decreasing near calving), showed temporal shifts reflecting dietary changes and physiological demands. Biogenic amines and AA-related metabolites involved in one-carbon metabolism (betaine and sarcosine, decreasing postweaning and prepartum), polyamine synthesis, and nitrogen catabolism demonstrated coordinated changes. Histidine-related metabolites (carnosine, increasing postweaning) indicated muscle maturation and adaptation to oxidative stress. Tryptophan-derived metabolites (kynurenine, serotonin, and indole metabolites) highlighted immune activation and microbial maturation. Nitrogen metabolism intermediates (citrulline and ornithine, decreasing postweaning; homoarginine, increasing at calving; phenylacetylglutamine, showing transient changes) reflected urea cycle and nitrogen disposal adjustments. Other metabolites, such as γ-aminobutyric acid, taurine, and lactate, displayed patterns indicative of neuroendocrine signaling, antioxidant defense, and energy metabolism shifts throughout development. Overall, plasma AA, biogenic amines, and AA-related metabolites in heifers are primarily influenced by developmental stage rather than TM feeding, with colostrum intake triggering rapid metabolic responses.",

Lactobacillus gasseri KML39 was selected based on its superior casein fermentation properties, proteolytic and antioxidant activities, and probiotic potential, including acid and bile tolerance and intestinal adhesion ability. We found that FSC significantly suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and reduced nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In DSS-induced colitis mice, body weight loss, shortened colon length, and colonic tissue damage were observed compared with the control group. Dextran sulfate sodium also activated NF-κB signaling, leading to the upregulation of iNOS and COX-2 in both colonic and brain tissues, along with elevated serum TNF-α and corticosterone levels. Furthermore, DSS treatment compromised intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity, as indicated by the downregulation of tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin-5). Additionally, DSS negatively regulated neurotransmitter receptors (NMDAR, GABAR, and D2DR) and neurodevelopmental markers (BAX and Bcl-2) in the brain, suggesting neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative effects. The FSC pretreatment effectively restored tight junction integrity, attenuated neuroinflammation, and improved gut microbiota composition. Notably, Proteobacteria and Bacteroides were significantly enriched in the DSS-treated group, whereas their abundance was normalized by FSC pretreatment. These findings highlight systemic inflammation as a key driver of colitis-associated neuroinflammation and demonstrate the potential of FSC as a therapeutic agent for gut-brain-microbiome axis dysfunction in colitis.",

Providing 3-NOP in a partial mixed ration or TMR is recommended to continuously expose the rumen to the additive. During grazing, there is temporarily no exposure to 3-NOP. Therefore, to use 3-NOP as a methane reduction measure in a grazing system, the effect of providing 3-NOP through a mixed ration provided inside the barn only on methane emissions needs further research. Therefore, an incomplete Latin square (balanced crossover) design with 40 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows (average milk yield of 39.8 ± 7.0 kg/d per cow, mean BW 691 ± 63.6 kg, average lactation stage of 122 ± 56 DIM, and a mean parity of 2.6 ± 1.2) was set up including 3 treatment periods and 4 treatments. The treatments consisted of full-time indoor housing with a placebo additive (A), full-time indoor housing with 80 mg 3-NOP/kg DMI (B), 6-h grazing with a placebo additive (C), and 6-h grazing with 80 mg 3-NOP/kg DMI (D). The 24 possible treatment sequences were randomized over the cows in a balanced way based on individual cow information including parity, BW, lactation stage, fat- and protein-corrected milk yield, roughage feed intake, and concentrate intake. The actual 3-NOP concentration in the total diet was 77 mg/kg in treatment B and 80 mg/kg in treatment D. Animal performance, fresh grass intake, methane emissions, and nutritional value of the feed were monitored throughout the experiment. Results showed that DMI was not different between treatments with the same housing conditions, but was significantly lower (-1.4 kg DM/d) for 6-h grazing compared with full-time indoor housing. The milk yield of grazing treatments was significantly lower (-1.6 kg/d) than full-time housed cows receiving the placebo, whereas the milk yield of full-time housed cows receiving 3-NOP was not different from the full-time housed placebo treatment, nor the grazing placebo treatment.

The objectives of this study were to quantify circulating concentrations of proteinogenic AA and branched-chain keto acid (BCKA) and characterize mRNA expression of key enzymes regulating branched-chain AA (BCAA) catabolism. Thirty-six multiparous Holstein cows were enrolled in a randomized block design, receiving continuous abomasal infusion for 21 d after parturition. Treatments (12 cows each) were control (CON), cows abomasally infused with 0.9% saline; cows abomasally infused with BCAA (67 g Val, 50 g Leu, and 34 g Ile; BCA); and cows abomasally infused with BCKA (77 g keto Val, 57 g keto Leu, and 39 g keto Ile; BCK). All cows were randomly assigned to treatments after parturition and received the same diet throughout the experimental period. Blood was collected at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 d postpartum for quantification of 20 AA with liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Liver was also harvested on 7, 14, and 21 d postpartum for quantification of BCAA catabolism genes. Compared with CON, BCA cows had higher plasma BCAA, keto Leu, and keto Ile (but not keto Val), along with higher plasma EAA and total AA (TAA). Abomasal BCKA infusion increased plasma BCKA, Val, and Ile (but not Leu), and elevated plasma EAA without affecting TAA. The BCK cows had higher overall plasma Met and His. Additionally, at specific time points measured, BCA cows had higher concentrations of Lys and Arg compared with CON cows, while BCK cows had higher concentrations of Phe, Met, His, and glutamate compared with CON cows. Compared with CON, BCA cows had greater expression of all BCAA/BCKA catabolism genes for at least one time point measured, whereas BCK cows only exhibited greater expression of Methylcrotonyl-CoA Carboxylase Subunit 1 and Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase on d 14 compared with CON. Overall, these results suggest that postruminal BCAA and BCKA infusion distinctly modulated AA profile and BCAA/BCKA catabolism in fresh cows, revealing divergent metabolic adaptations. These findings highlight the distinct roles of BCAA and BCKA in nutrient utilization and metabolic function during early lactation. Future work is required to evaluate specific changes in the interrelated metabolism of BCAA and BCKA to clarify their specific contributions to lactation performance and metabolic regulation.",

Greater disturbances in cell structure were observed in pasteurized juice, which may contribute to enhanced protein release. Notably, the 12 proteins that decreased in processed juice were primarily enzymes, with fructose-bisphosphate aldolase exhibiting significant variation and selected as processing marker. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that processing led to structural change of the marker, manifesting as α-helix reduction and random coil elevation, probably resulting in conformational destabilization prone to degradation.

This study examines kappa (κ) and iota (ι) carrageenan effects on protein interactions and structural development in HMMAs, hypothesising that the sulphate-group density influences protein denaturation, molecular alignment, and network stability. Structural, chemical, and textural analyses of HMMAs manufactured with κ- or ι-carrageenan (0.5 %, 1 %, and 2 %) indicated that ι-carrageenan enhanced fibrous network formation by increasing disulfide bonding, β-sheet formation, and protein interactions, showing greater effects at higher concentrations, whereas κ-carrageenan primarily promoted ionic interactions, minimally affecting texture. These findings elucidate the ability to use sulphate-group variations for protein-structure modulation in HMMAs and underscore the importance of hydrocolloid selection in optimising plant-based meat analogues. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms will aid hydrocolloid selection for plant-based meat formulations, contributing towards fundamental protein-structure research and applied food technology.",

This study aimed to profile concentration patterns including interspecies and regional variations between Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea, and to explore correlations of nutrients and contaminants in five commercially important Arctic marine fish species using supervised machine learning applied to analytical data. These multivariate patterns were subsequently used as input in Monte Carlo simulations to assess the benefit and risk of fish consumption.

Fatty fish, especially Atlantic mackerel and herring had higher nutrient scores than lean fish. Consuming lean fish from 300 to 450 g per week did not entail risk of excessive Hg, dioxins and DL-PCBs exposure. Although weekly consumption of more than 190 g of mackerel or 130 g of herring from the Norwegian Sea, may exceed the tolerable weekly intake for dioxins and DL-PCBs (P > 0.05), both species are excellent sources of EPA + DHA, Se and vitamin D.

It was determined that positively charged amino acids such as histidine, arginine, and lysine, alongside negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acid, as well as the polar amino acid cysteine, can bind to Zn ions in cancer-related ZBPs. Most cancer-related ZBPs are intracellularly localized, found in the nucleoplasm, nuclear vesicles, and nucleoli, and primarily function as transferases or DNA-binding proteins. These cancer-related ZBPs are located on chromosomes 3, 11, and 19. A total of 46 cancer-related ZBPs exhibited interactions with one another, demonstrating complex inter- and intracellular co-regulation of molecular functions and protein-protein interactions. Mutations impact the Zn ion binding sites of many cancer-related ZBPs. Eleven cancer-related ZBPs (TRIM24, WT1, BCL6, MECOM, PATZ1, IKZF3, ZBTB16, ZNF521, BCL11B, TRIM33, and RAF1) were identified as oncogenic, tumor suppressor, and fusion proteins.

However, chickens carry many fatal diseases that compromise their welfare and negatively affect productivity. Among these, coccidiosis, an intestinal disease caused by Eimeria protozoan parasites, affects multiple animal species and represents a major threat to the poultry industry. Eimeria parasites invade the host cell through a distinctive process, depending on gliding motility, and require a transmembrane link between the host cell and parasite cytoskeleton. Each species invades intestinal epithelial cells in a specific gut region, leading to varying tissue damage and morbidity levels. Understanding the preliminary host-parasite interactions is crucial to revealing Eimeria species' conduct and cellular immune responses mediating the primary and secondary coccidian infection, which can inform the development of effective immunological strategies. The interaction between Eimeria invasion proteins and intestinal epithelial cells provokes a moderate immune response marked by elevated IFN-γ and IL-10 production in chickens. In this review, we highlight recent breakthroughs in understanding the Eimeria parasites that affect the host intestinal tract, emphasizing parasite invasion mechanisms, transmission dynamics, host immune responses, coccidian control mechanisms, and the interaction between host microbiota and coccidia. In conclusion, advancing our understanding of Eimeria invasion mechanisms and coccidia control requires a complex approach that combines cutting-edge molecular insights with innovative therapeutic strategies.",

Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the existing limitations and future opportunities of AI technology in the field of FDPs is required. This review evaluates traditional methodologies and AI applications in FDP research, addressing current limitations and prospects. AI faces several challenges in predicting complex protein structures and FDPs. Dimensionality curse and local optima during protein structure prediction reduce accuracy. In FDP prediction, the selection of amino acid descriptors limits model stability. Additionally, the scarcity of FDP datasets leads to accuracy reduction in AI model training and introduces class distribution bias. Traditional cross-entropy loss further exacerbates class distribution skew. These issues collectively constrain the application of AI in FDP prediction. AI enhances peptide screening efficiency through large-scale data processing, reducing research costs. Standardized multidimensional databases integrated with heterogeneous AI architectures improve predictive model accuracy and cross-domain adaptability. Computational visualization frameworks elucidate bioactive determinants and quantitative structure-activity relationships. Metabolomic-gut microbiota interdisciplinary strategies enable the precision design of bioactive peptides for personalized nutrition. AI-optimized enzymatic hydrolysis processes and high-throughput validation platforms advance mechanistic understanding and industrial production, despite the persisting challenges. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Thus, five groups of 60 tilapia each, in three replicates, were randomly selected from 300 fingerlings of Oreochromis niloticus (15.63 ± 0.05 g, SE). The first group was fed a basic diet and raised in clean water. The remaining fish were grouped into four groups, reared in water polluted with partially lethal trichlorfon concentration (0.38 mg/l), and fed with formulated diets consisting of trichlorfon (control diet), Se-Cys (selenium cysteine), nano-Se (Se nanoparticle), and Se-Met (Se-methionine) added at 1 mg/kg diet each for 90 days, followed by challenge with A. hydrophila. Enhanced growth, improved hematological profile (RBCs, WBCs, Hb, PCV) and minimum serum stress (ALT, AST, glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol) with elevated immunological indices (NBT, lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, albumin, globulin, total protein) were performed by nano-Se supplemented group. Additionally, antioxidant enzyme assays and oxidative stress gene expression (CAT, SOD, GPx, and GST) were effectively augmented by the same group in the sampled tissues. Nano-Se group was noticed by upregulated immune-related selenoproteins (Sepp1a, SelK, GPx2, and SelW) in gill and liver tissues. In contrast, immune stress genes (CASP3, HSP70, TNF-α, and IL-β) were upregulated in the trichlorfon group. Stress hormone biomarkers (cortisol, GH, TSH, T3, T4) and intestinal enzymes (protease, lipase, and amylase) were effectively achieved by the Se-incorporated groups. All Se sources exhibited minimum cumulative mortality compared to the control in response to A. hydrophila. Liver tissues exhibited the maximum Se bioaccumulation and Se concentration factor among all the sampled tissues. This is the first report that we are aware of examining the comparative effects of Se sources on trichlorfon stress in fish models. It could be concluded that supplementation with different forms of Se, mainly nano-Se, successfully ameliorated the toxic effects of trichlorfon in tilapia.",
