You can have much higher amounts of protein and your body will digest and use it just fine.\n\n>we show that the ingestion of 100 g protein results in a greater and more prolonged (>12 h) anabolic response when compared to the ingestion of 25 g protein.\nhttps://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(23)00540-2\n\nIt varies greatly per individual what their upper limit for uptake is and how much the body disposes as “excess”. People who do a lot of strength training will need a lot more protein for muscles that were broken down during workout to be build back up again, resulting in a lot less protein to be excreted. \n\nIn people with insuline resistance the body converts excess protein into glucose, so a lot less protein will be excreted. Similar process happens for people on low carb diets. \n\nThere are many different factors at play, there is no size (or amount of protein) that fits all.\n\nIt takes a lot longer than 4 hours for food to be fully processed by the body too.\n\nAFAIK, the original place this misconstruation came from was the science behind finding the *minimum* amount of protein per bolus of protein (ie meal), under the presence of enough leucine, to trigger muscle protein synthesis optimally — that’s where the 30g comes from.\n\nBut again: that’s the minimum value for an optimal state. We utilize all protein, carbs, and fats that enter our bodies, short of the amount burned do to the thermic effect of food.",

        "text": "So it’s very complicated and it’s impossible to say exactly what’s happening, but probably easiest to think of it this way:\n\nThe total amount of protein per day you have is your stored protein. That is what is used for everything, not just muscles but all the body processes. It’s very important for muscle growth that the body never has to ration that out, so you want to consistently eat adequate protein. Muscle growth is one of the first things to get cut.\n\nThe timing of that protein is just a signal. When the body sees it’s getting a big chunk of protein (varies a lot Ill go over this) then it says “ok boys we’re in the green let’s party”, and it stimulates MPS (muscle protein synthesis) which is a big boost to your gains. This lasts for around 4-6 hours \n\nUnfortunately it gets a lot more complex than that. There’s a limit to that MPS effect, if you “spike” it too many times, the spikes will decrease, and you’ll end up at about the same spot, or in some cases you’ll have lower MPS. \n\n3-4 protein feedings a day seems to be the sweet spot, but we’re talking fractions of a percent of difference  in the 2-6 window\n\nSo, overall, the message is what it always. Eat a normal amount of meals, a decent chunk of protein, you’re good to go.\n\nNow, one thing that’s gotten some really research is age and how it affects MPS. It seems that children have MPS that is super powered. They will be fully stimulated with ~8g of protein. That’s why you’ll see kids who eat nothing but crackers and pasta and they’re not withered away. On the other end of that, 60+ year olds might neeed as much as 45-50g for the full effect.\n\nSo, we see a spectrum here, and that means we probably should be more focused on protein feedings as we age. Protein reqs might rise slightly as well, but the MPS seems to be the big factor here.",

I like thinking of my dietary timescale in terms of weeks, rather than days or even hours, and that helps me to both relax when I have a not-great day, but also to look for my progress that happens over months rather than in a week or two.\n\nMost people in the western world simply don't exercise enough for muscle growth (2 days per week - every week - of moderately heavy resistance training is bare minimum IMO with something like 4 being much better). Likewise, they also don't eat enough protein for muscle growth either. So if your weekly average protein intake is high enough, you are going to reap like 90% of the benefits that the daily person doesn't - without even having to care about if you drank your shake at breakfast, or just after your workout, etc.",

    "combined_text": "Title: How Does Protein Effect a Wourkout Time-wise?\n\nPost: I will preface this by saying that I understand that a constant good diet and constant workout/exercise is best. I am asking just to better understand how the protein helps.\n\nIf I were to work out one time, and have only one day that i have a high protein meal, would it be best to have that meal the night before a workout, the day of the workout, or the day after the workout? So im asking if its the protein already in your system (day before), or the protein that's starting digestion (day of), or the protein while sore and in recovery (day after), that has the largest effect on muscle growth? \n\nAgain, im asking solely to understand how protein actually affects muscle growth, not looking to only eat protein once every 3 days or looking for diet advice, thanks!\n\nComments:\nBarely matters at all as long as you supply your body with enough of all the amino acids it needs. The most important factor that determines the hypertrophy you're going to get is whether or not your workout created the molecular signal to trigger hypertrophy, and that's going to be much more dependant on your glycogen status (how depleted or glycogen loaded you are), which is going to impact your performance and thus the hypertrophy stimulus you can generate, and your carbohydrate intake is going to determine this (obviously depends on a variety of other factors not related to diet). If you create the stimulus and the protein is there, the fibers must and will grow\n\nProtein timing has a teeny tiny impact on growth, it's mostly marketing and nerd min/maxing.\n\nIf you can have a shake post work out, do it.\n\nIf not, it's not worth changing your day to make it happen.\n\nSo it’s very complicated and it’s impossible to say exactly what’s happening, but probably easiest to think of it this way:\n\nThe total amount of protein per day you have is your stored protein. That is what is used for everything, not just muscles but all the body processes. It’s very important for muscle growth that the body never has to ration that out, so you want to consistently eat adequate protein. Muscle growth is one of the first things to get cut.\n\nThe timing of that protein is just a signal. When the body sees it’s getting a big chunk of protein (varies a lot Ill go over this) then it says “ok boys we’re in the green let’s party”, and it stimulates MPS (muscle protein synthesis) which is a big boost to your gains. This lasts for around 4-6 hours \n\nUnfortunately it gets a lot more complex than that. There’s a limit to that MPS effect, if you “spike” it too many times, the spikes will decrease, and you’ll end up at about the same spot, or in some cases you’ll have lower MPS. \n\n3-4 protein feedings a day seems to be the sweet spot, but we’re talking fractions of a percent of difference  in the 2-6 window\n\nSo, overall, the message is what it always. Eat a normal amount of meals, a decent chunk of protein, you’re good to go.\n\nNow, one thing that’s gotten some really research is age and how it affects MPS. It seems that children have MPS that is super powered. They will be fully stimulated with ~8g of protein. That’s why you’ll see kids who eat nothing but crackers and pasta and they’re not withered away. On the other end of that, 60+ year olds might neeed as much as 45-50g for the full effect.\n\nSo, we see a spectrum here, and that means we probably should be more focused on protein feedings as we age. Protein reqs might rise slightly as well, but the MPS seems to be the big factor here.\n\nYeah the effect of timing is really very minimal. I like thinking of my dietary timescale in terms of weeks, rather than days or even hours, and that helps me to both relax when I have a not-great day, but also to look for my progress that happens over months rather than in a week or two.\n\nMost people in the western world simply don't exercise enough for muscle growth (2 days per week - every week - of moderately heavy resistance training is bare minimum IMO with something like 4 being much better). Likewise, they also don't eat enough protein for muscle growth either. So if your weekly average protein intake is high enough, you are going to reap like 90% of the benefits that the daily person doesn't - without even having to care about if you drank your shake at breakfast, or just after your workout, etc.\n\nYou can't \"overdose\" on protein.\n\n\nYour body doesn't discard \"excess\" protein.\n\nEat 1g of protein per lb of body weight (or ideal body weight if you're overweight/obese) and try to hit that target as you eat throughout the day.  \n\nYour body will do the rest.\n\nIt’s good to have circulating amino acids in your system during your workout. Pre workout nutrition is better than post workout nutrition because of the performance aspect. The “Anabolic Window” doesn’t really exist\n\nYou can read the [Pre-workout section in my Bulking article](https://originsymmetrics.com/how-to-properly-bulk/#Nutrition_around_workout) to see how much to eat and when\n\nAlso, everyday your protein intake should be high/sufficient. Just upping protein intake for days you workout won’t do anything. You don’t build muscle in those 24 hrs\n\n[protein timing is irrelevant](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3879660/):\n\n>A simple pooled analysis of protein timing without controlling for covariates showed a small to moderate effect on muscle hypertrophy with no significant effect found on muscle strength.

That data can vary considerably as shown by the variety in quantity of one nutrient between different samples on the usda site.\n\nIn sum, I don't think there is a way for us as consumers to definitely know the precise values of the nutrients in the foods we buy. At best, the nutrition labels provide a rough guesstimate. For me, I feel okay about that mostly,  as long as I come close to meeting my nutritional needs",

Before when one of them was running cross country I would bring him home and he would usually eat some eggs and toast. (And usually still be hungry 🤪) but now I need something we can have on the go for breakfast since we won’t be going home between gym and school. I plan to do like breakfast burritos, egg scramble muffin things, fruit, etc. but I was thinking about having them drink a protein drink too to help fill them up as well as get in some extra protein. Any suggestions on which premade protein drink is healthiest (I’m going to be honest I probably won’t have time to make our own. I work three jobs and it just is what it is) or other great on the go breakfast ideas that 13yo and 11yo boys will actually eat!

It in has all 9 essential amino acids, but only very low amounts of Lysine, luckily, legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc) are a high protein food with a high amount of lysine but low in methionine.  Rice happens to have a high amount of. Which is why you often hear beans and rice form a complete protein. Individually neither rice nor legumes are a complete protein, but together they are. While sugar contains no protein/amino acids. \n\nBut to answer your question, functionally, eating rice is not the same as eating sugar. For starters, sugar is more than three times more calorically dense than rice. You have to eat more than 300g of rice to reach the same amount of carbohydrates as 100g of sugar. The volume makes a difference in satiation. 100g of sugar will give you the calories, but will not signal to your brain you’re full, so you continue feel hungry and crave more food. Rice is also a neutral food, which means it can be eaten with other food, to make it more filling. \n\nAdditionally, consider the starch in rice transforms into resistant starch once cooked, cooled and reheated, and act more like fiber than starch during the digestive process, which not only triggers a lower glycemic response, it’s is also beneficial to your gut microbiome.\n\nSo while you can get the same values of carbohydrate from rice and sugar, rice is more versatile and more nutritious when eaten with other foods, because it complements the nutritional profiles of especially other plant based protein sources.",

It in has all 9 essential amino acids, but only very low amounts of Lysine, luckily, legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc) are a high protein food with a high amount of lysine but low in methionine.  Rice happens to have a high amount of. Which is why you often hear beans and rice form a complete protein. Individually neither rice nor legumes are a complete protein, but together they are. While sugar contains no protein/amino acids. \n\nBut to answer your question, functionally, eating rice is not the same as eating sugar. For starters, sugar is more than three times more calorically dense than rice. You have to eat more than 300g of rice to reach the same amount of carbohydrates as 100g of sugar. The volume makes a difference in satiation. 100g of sugar will give you the calories, but will not signal to your brain you’re full, so you continue feel hungry and crave more food. Rice is also a neutral food, which means it can be eaten with other food, to make it more filling. \n\nAdditionally, consider the starch in rice transforms into resistant starch once cooked, cooled and reheated, and act more like fiber than starch during the digestive process, which not only triggers a lower glycemic response, it’s is also beneficial to your gut microbiome.\n\nSo while you can get the same values of carbohydrate from rice and sugar, rice is more versatile and more nutritious when eaten with other foods, because it complements the nutritional profiles of especially other plant based protein sources.\n\nWhy health-conscious people avoid processed sugar but not white rice:\n\nWhite rice (despite being a high-glycemic carb) is often paired with nutrient-dense foods (vegetables, proteins, fats) in balanced meals, slowing digestion and glycemic impact. \n\nProcessed sugar is typically consumed in isolation (soda, candy) or in nutrient-poor foods, which spikes blood sugar rapidly.\n\nIf you look into cultural dietary patterns, rice-based cultures (e.g., Asian) often have balanced diets w/ vegetables, lean proteins, and lower processed food intake, unlike sugar-heavy Western diets.\n\nI'd argue that when you eat white rice, you must chew that food which causes neurological signals from the masseters to signal food being eaten so you cant eat as much rice as you can sugar. Also, amylase is being released when you eat rice which may also have a rate limiting effect.\n\n\nThe simplest answer though is the more isolated and refined a macro is (and this goes for whey isolate too) the completely different effect it will have on the body than the initial food in complete form would, even if it too is high in the macro being consumed.\n\nI’m confused as to why you don’t think rice has micro-nutrients.  Please look that up, it absolutely has fiber, protein, vitamins & minerals.",

Your 100 g of daily protein isn’t used exclusively for muscle growth, much of it supports maintenance of existing tissues, enzyme and hormone production, immune function, and other processes. Muscle gain is also limited by your body’s capacity to synthesize new tissue, on average, people can gain 0.25–0.5 kg of lean mass per week with optimal training and nutrition. So it’s not that you’re wasting protein, but that muscle growth is a slow, regulated process, not a direct “input-output” system.",

        "text": "The reason the math doesn’t “add up” is that **muscle growth is far more complex than simply converting dietary protein into muscle tissue**.\n\n* **Muscle is dynamic tissue.** It’s constantly breaking down and rebuilding depending on your fasting state, nutrient storage, engagement in activities, physiological and psychological stress, medication and a lot of other reasosns. Even at maintenance, a lot of the protein you eat is used to replace existing proteins, not just build new muscle\n* **Protein is not only used for muscle synthesis.** Only a fraction of protein intake is used for that reason. Other amino acid utilisation includes enzyme production, energy production when needed, hormone production, and immune function.\n* **Muscle building is regulated.** Even if you eat a lot of protein, your body has a limit to how fast it can synthesise new muscle. Training, hormones, genetics, and recovery are the main drivers. >!Fun fact: anabolic steroids can lift this limit. ***obviously with severe and dangerous side effects. DO NOT USE THEM***!<\n* **Muscle gain includes more than protein.** Lean muscle mass is \\~22% protein by weight, but the rest (water, glycogen, minerals,) also depends on factors like hydration and carbohydrate intake.\n\n  \n**What** **you should focus on:**\n\n1. **Balanced eating:** Eat around 1,4 - 2,0 g/kg protein to maximize muscle growth. Eat carbs and vegetables too, healthy fats will assist your overall health and muscle building journey.\n2. Train regularly: Resistance training will stimulate muscle growth. Do not skip out on cardio, it has very important positive metabolic outcomes that will lead to less protein being used for energy production and more going to your muscles.\n3. **Sleep well:** Sleep is ofter overlooked but is just as important as the other elements in muscle building and post workout recovery.\n4. **Skip alcohol:** Literally a toxin. Less literally, it \"kills your gains\".\n5. **Supplementation:** Try to hit protein and nutritional goals through whole foods. A good protein supplement or protein + carbs supplement is helpful if you can't. Anything other than creating and maybe a multivitamin is mostly considered not effective, except if you're a really high level athlete and following a completely tailored fitness and diet plan and are under constant medical supervision.",

    "combined_text": "Title: Protein for building a kilogram of lean muscle?\n\nPost: So basically I came across the fact that human muscles are only 22% protein,rest is water, glucose and other stuff. \nThis got me curious 🤨.\n I intake 100gm of protein a day, assuming all of it is absorbed by my body and most of it is going in repairing and building muscles, I'd be putting on at least 500 gms of lean muscle every day which is clearly not the case. \nSo either of two things is the case: \n1) It actually takes much more protein than 100 gm to make 500 gm of muscle, i.e. the conversion isn't proportional to 1:5.\n2) Or, my body just doesn't need 100 gms of protein a day and isn't absorbing most of it.\n\nNow this might be a dumb question as I have no idea about the biology being this stuff, but the math isn't adding up.\nPls help.\n\nComments:\nBuilding 1kg of lean muscle isn’t just about depositing 220g of protein, it also requires energy, hormones, training stimulus, time, and cellular adaptations. Your 100 g of daily protein isn’t used exclusively for muscle growth, much of it supports maintenance of existing tissues, enzyme and hormone production, immune function, and other processes. Muscle gain is also limited by your body’s capacity to synthesize new tissue, on average, people can gain 0.25–0.5 kg of lean mass per week with optimal training and nutrition. So it’s not that you’re wasting protein, but that muscle growth is a slow, regulated process, not a direct “input-output” system.\n\nThe reason the math doesn’t “add up” is that **muscle growth is far more complex than simply converting dietary protein into muscle tissue**.\n\n* **Muscle is dynamic tissue.** It’s constantly breaking down and rebuilding depending on your fasting state, nutrient storage, engagement in activities, physiological and psychological stress, medication and a lot of other reasosns. Even at maintenance, a lot of the protein you eat is used to replace existing proteins, not just build new muscle\n* **Protein is not only used for muscle synthesis.** Only a fraction of protein intake is used for that reason. Other amino acid utilisation includes enzyme production, energy production when needed, hormone production, and immune function.\n* **Muscle building is regulated.** Even if you eat a lot of protein, your body has a limit to how fast it can synthesise new muscle. Training, hormones, genetics, and recovery are the main drivers. >!Fun fact: anabolic steroids can lift this limit. ***obviously with severe and dangerous side effects. DO NOT USE THEM***!<\n* **Muscle gain includes more than protein.** Lean muscle mass is \\~22% protein by weight, but the rest (water, glycogen, minerals,) also depends on factors like hydration and carbohydrate intake.\n\n  \n**What** **you should focus on:**\n\n1. **Balanced eating:** Eat around 1,4 - 2,0 g/kg protein to maximize muscle growth. Eat carbs and vegetables too, healthy fats will assist your overall health and muscle building journey.\n2. Train regularly: Resistance training will stimulate muscle growth. Do not skip out on cardio, it has very important positive metabolic outcomes that will lead to less protein being used for energy production and more going to your muscles.\n3. **Sleep well:** Sleep is ofter overlooked but is just as important as the other elements in muscle building and post workout recovery.\n4. **Skip alcohol:** Literally a toxin. Less literally, it \"kills your gains\".\n5. **Supplementation:** Try to hit protein and nutritional goals through whole foods. A good protein supplement or protein + carbs supplement is helpful if you can't. Anything other than creating and maybe a multivitamin is mostly considered not effective, except if you're a really high level athlete and following a completely tailored fitness and diet plan and are under constant medical supervision.\n\nAmino acids are used for many different things your body does. This is why you need a lot of protein to build muscle. \n\nYour body only grows what it can afford.\n\nYou need protein for basic maintenance of your body. Every tiny little part of you needs protein. Not just your muscles. We need more details. What’s your height, weight, gender, exercise regimen. \n\nI’m pretty confident you are under eating protein. You’re body needs excess amounts of materials and energy to create more muscle mass. Especially if you want to create it quickly.",

The idea was to try to figure out which foods gave people the most sustained feeling of satiety per calorie, and their study included 38 common foods. I find the recommendations personally useful but, since the original list is pretty limited, it’s surprising that it doesn’t seem like their methodology for finding satiety indices has ever been extended to more foods nor have I seen replications. This seems like a really useful tool for weight loss, and the methodology makes it sound pretty simple to perform. It also had some counter-intuitive results like boiled potatoes being by far most satiating foods despite a lot of modern diet advice focusing on protein and fiber for fullness, which I think would be worth exploring further.\n\nIs there a reason nothing else was done with the satiety index concept or are there other more recent papers I’m missing?

    "combined_text": "Title: Why wasn’t more work done with the satiety index?\n\nPost: I see the paper [1995 paper “A satiety index of common foods”](http://www.ernaehrungsdenkwerkstatt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/EDWText/TextElemente/Ernaehrungswissenschaft/Naehrstoffe/Saettigung_Lebensmittel_Satiety_Index.pdf) mentioned a lot when people are talking about nutrition and diet advice. The idea was to try to figure out which foods gave people the most sustained feeling of satiety per calorie, and their study included 38 common foods. I find the recommendations personally useful but, since the original list is pretty limited, it’s surprising that it doesn’t seem like their methodology for finding satiety indices has ever been extended to more foods nor have I seen replications. This seems like a really useful tool for weight loss, and the methodology makes it sound pretty simple to perform. It also had some counter-intuitive results like boiled potatoes being by far most satiating foods despite a lot of modern diet advice focusing on protein and fiber for fullness, which I think would be worth exploring further.\n\nIs there a reason nothing else was done with the satiety index concept or are there other more recent papers I’m missing? \n\nComments:\nGo look at [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5653769_Acyl_and_Total_Ghrelin_Are_Suppressed_Strongly_by_Ingested_Proteins_Weakly_by_Lipids_and_Biphasically_by_Carbohydrates), especially at Figure 3. \n\nIt shows that while carbohydrates are good at depressing ghrelin for the first two hours - which is why they look good at the 120 minutes - but after 180 minutes there is a big spike in ghrelin which is exactly what you don't want when you are looking for satiety. \n\nLipids and protein don't exhibit that pattern; they provide less depression in ghrelin but it continues for far longer.\n\nI have seen that the best predictor of satiety is making sure your meals combine protein + fiber + fat. So for example a steak with broccoli or full-fat yogurt with berries.",

Assuming you're 88 kg or below, you're probably fine quantity size. (1.8 g/kg bodyweight.) Most of your sources are complete (estimated at >80%) so you are probably fine. \nSoy protein is complete on its own. If you combine peas with rice they complement each other (I don't have the ratios at the ready) so they are complete proteins together. So you could add some rice to your diet to complement the peas.\n Taking targeted supplements seems unnecessarily expensive to me. Adding rice or quinoa to your diet is probably a lot cheaper. (Based on a video made by dr. in exercise physiology Mike Israetel.)\n\nif building muscle is your goal, don't forget to chill, sleep and train hard.\n\nGaps only matter if your protein sources are almost purely plant sources—-which would require around 20% more total protein intake.

    "combined_text": "Integrative Omics Reveals Glutamine Catabolism-Driven Apoptotic Suppression in Monocytes upon Mechanical Unloading.\n\nOsteoclasts derived bone marrow monocytes have been documented to modulate bone quality by directly sensing mechanical forces. However, the mechanisms by which osteoclasts perceive and respond to mechanical disturbances remain unclear. Through integrating multi-omics data of bone tissues from hindlimb unloading (HLU) and control mice, it is revealed that glutamine (Gln) catabolism-induced suppression of apoptosis is critical for monocytes sensing and responding to mechanical unloading. Gln uptake is essential for the survival of monocytes under mechanical unloading. Deprivation of Gln or blockade of Gln transporter solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) inhibits bone resorption by enhancing apoptosis of monocytes. Unloading exposure-induced cell survival is mediated by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)/direct IAP binding protein with low pI (Diablo) axis. Upon mechanical unloading XIAP is upregulated, then interacts with Diablo in mitochondrial and promotes the K63-linkage ubiquitylation of Diablo at the K212 site. This sequesters Diablo within the mitochondrial and inhibits its release into the cytosol, ultimately inhibiting cell apoptosis of osteoclasts and the precursors. Clinically, the serum Gln levels are positively correlated with cross linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) levels, indicating that serum Gln levels might serve as a potential biomarker for predicting the risk of osteoporosis. Gln-deficient diet, as well as SLC1A5 inhibitor L-γ-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (GPNA), effectively preserves bone mass in HLU mice, implicating attractive approaches for combating bone loss induced by weightlessness or disuse.",

Traditional anterior-posterior surgery is effective but highly invasive, leading to greater trauma and longer recovery. Minimally invasive techniques, such as oblique lumbar debridement with posterior percutaneous fixation, may reduce surgical damage and improve recovery. However, their efficacy remains unclear. This study compares this minimally invasive approach with conventional surgery to assess its feasibility as an alternative treatment.\n\nA retrospective analysis was conducted on 156 patients diagnosed with single-segment lumbar tuberculosis between July 2016 and October 2019. Patients were divided into a minimally invasive group (Min group, n = 76), treated with the oblique lumbar approach combined with Posterior Percutaneous Pedicle Screw Fixation (PPPSF), and a conventional Open group (n = 80). All patients received standard anti-tuberculosis therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for at least two weeks preoperatively and continued for 10-12 months postoperatively, adjusted based on drug sensitivity testing. Nutritional support and bracing for three months post-surgery were also provided. Surgical and postoperative metrics were evaluated, including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of abdominal incision, postoperative drainage volume and postoperative hospital stay. Functional outcomes were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and oswestry disability index (ODI), while serology markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were measured. Radiographic parameters, including the Cobb angle and sagittal vertical axis (SVA), were also evaluated. Postoperative complications were also documented.\n\nThe Min group demonstrated significantly shorter operation time, smaller incisions, reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and lower postoperative drainage and CPK levels compared to the conventional Open group (\n\nOblique lumbar debridement with PPPSF represents a viable alternative to traditional anterior-posterior surgery for single-segment lumbar tuberculosis, offering reduced surgical trauma and accelerated postoperative recovery.",

A significant factor contributing to these harmful lifestyle choices is the overconsumption of highly processed, energy-dense foods that are rich in saturated and trans fats, sodium, and added sugars, Conversely, adopting healthier dietary patterns that prioritize the intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats has been shown to protect against these chronic health conditions. Investigating the diverse health benefits of natural food sources requires a holistic approach encompassing dietary intake evaluations, laboratory and animal studies, and human clinical research. These investigations examine the antimicrobial, antioxidant, cancer-fighting, and blood sugar-regulating properties of compounds derived from plants. Studies indicate that diets abundant in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables supply crucial nutrients and biologically active substances such as polyphenols and flavonoids, which provide protective benefits against long-term disease conditions, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Consequently, it is imperative to adjust our dietary practices and lifestyle choices to mitigate the risk of various ailments. Naturally occurring compounds such as curcumin, quercetin, kaempferol, and resveratrol, which are found in diverse food sources, have the potential to combat numerous diseases when incorporated into our diets. This review explores an array of compounds present in dietary sources and their associated biomedical properties, including their anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, it explores various dietrelated strategies designed to promote a healthier lifestyle, including the incorporation of a diverse range of fruits, vegetables, and spices rich in polyphenolic compounds into one's daily nutritional intake.",

Here, we report that the supplemental NaCl in standard NGM, ∼50 mM, accelerates aging and decreases lifespan. For comparison, we prepared NGM with reduced NaCl or excess NaCl. Considering reduced NaCl as a baseline, wild-type worms on standard NGM displayed normal development and fertility but reduced lifespan and health span, indicating toxicity in old animals. The long-lived mutants daf-2, age-1, and nuo-6, cultured on standard NGM, also displayed reduced lifespan. Thus, NaCl in standard NGM accelerates aging in multiple genetic backgrounds. Wild-type worms on excess NaCl displayed delayed development and reduced fertility, and reduced lifespan and health span, indicating toxicity in both young and old animals. These results suggest that young animals are relatively resistant to NaCl toxicity, but that aging causes progressive sensitivity, such that old animals display toxicity to both standard and excess NaCl. We investigated pathways that respond to NaCl. Young animals cultured with excess NaCl activated gpdh-1, a specific response to NaCl stress. Old animals cultured with excess NaCl activated gpdh-1 and hsp-6, a reporter for the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Thus, excess NaCl activates multiple stress response pathways in older animals.",

Conducting research on the formation mechanism and regulatory approaches of artificial grassland productivity is the great significance for improving grassland productivity, and restoration and reconstruction of degraded grassland. Select three-year-old sheep grassland as the experimental field, diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6), brassinolide (BR), and melatonin (MT) were sprayed to explore the regulatory mechanisms and differential efficacy of different phytohormones on grassland productivity. MT promotes chlorophyll synthesis, drives enhanced photosynthesis and protein synthesis, DA-6 upregulated photochemical efficiency and improves the stability of light energy conversion. BR enhances water use efficiency (WUE) through synergistic effects of pore regulation. MT demonstrated significant in the accumulation of biomass during the early and middle growth stages, and upgrade the nutritional quality of forage. DA-6 is suitable for biomass accumulation in the later growth stage. BR has outstanding potential in water conservation and stress resistance capacity. This study elucidates the differences in the regulatory effects of different growth regulators on the productivity of sheep pastures, in order to providing technical insights to optimize the technical strategy for grassland restoration and mitigate the contradiction between the degradation of natural grasslands and the development of animal husbandry.",

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), a highly aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract with poor prognosis, the latest clinical trials using TGF-β inhibitors have failed indicating that the specific actions carried out by TGF-β in iCCA are yet not well delineated. Here, we show that TGF-β signalling is highly active in iCCA and exerts a prominent suppressor effect on tumour cell lines and organoids established from iCCA metastases biopsies, that relies on a functional canonical SMAD2/3/4 signalling. Thus, TGF-β inhibitors promote, instead of inhibiting, tumour cell growth. In this context, a promising strategy is to target intracellular proteins downstream the TGF-β receptors accounting only for TGF-β pro-tumorigenic actions. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a downstream mediator of the TGF-β signalling pathway, is strictly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) of iCCA and acts in concert with NOX1 to regulate CAF functions. Use of a dual NOX4/NOX1 inhibitor impaired CAF actions and reduced tumour growth in vitro and in two different in vivo iCCA experimental models. Collectively, our findings reveal an actionable way to specifically target TGF-β pro-tumorigenic actions in CAF from iCCA without undesirable side effects on tumour cells, suggesting a potentially bright future for dual NOX4/NOX1 inhibitors in the clinics, alone or in combination with other therapies.",

Patients with severe gastrointestinal function injury admitted to the ICU from February 2021 to January 2024 were enrolled [age > 18 years old, acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) grade 2 to 3, stable hemodynamics]. Patients with different AGI grades were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the TEAS group and the control group using simple randomization. Both groups received conventional treatment and enteral nutrition (EN). In addition, the TEAS group underwent TEAS at the Neiguan and Zusanli points for 30 minutes per session, twice daily for 7 days. Baseline data, including age, gender, underlying diseases, and primary diagnoses, were recorded. Three intestinal biomarkers, such as I-FABP, D-lactic acid, and citrulline were measured before and after 7 days of treatment. EN tolerance indicators and 28 days survival status were documented. The differences in various indicators were compared between the two groups, subgroup analyses were conducted based on AGI grading, and interaction between AGI grade and TEAS were analyzed. The 28-day Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for both groups.\n\nFinally, 133 patients were included, with 68 in the TEAS group and 65 in the control group. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. A comparison of the dynamic changes in intestinal biomarkers revealed that the I-FABP level in both groups decreased after treatment compared to pre-treatment, with a more pronounced reduction in the TEAS group. The least square mean difference (LS Mean difference) for the corrected I-FABP level between the two groups during the observation period was -0.23 μg/L [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was -0.45 to -0.01], which was statistically significant (P = 0.041). Additionally, a significant interaction with AGI was observed (P = 0.004). Post-treatment, D-lactic acid level decreased in both groups compared to pre-treatment, with a more significant reduction in the TEAS group. The LS Mean difference for the corrected D-lactic acid level was -0.08 mmol/L (95%CI was -0.11 to -0.05), which was statistically significant (P < 0.001), and the interaction with AGI was also significant (P = 0.005). There was no significant change in citrulline levels between the two groups before and after treatment. The LS Mean difference for the corrected citrulline level was -0.17 μmol/L (95%CI was -1.87 to 1.53), which was not statistically significant (P = 0.845), and no significant interaction with AGI was observed (P = 0.913). Comparison of EN tolerance parameters between the two groups revealed that the TEAS group had a longer total EN time (hours: 72±31 vs. 60±28) and higher total EN calories (kJ: 11 469.23±7 237.34 vs. 6 638.76±5 098.37), as well as a higher 70% target caloric attainment rate (52.9% vs. 32.3%) compared to the control group (all P < 0.05). The incidence of abdominal distension after EN was lower in the TEAS group than that in the control group (23.5% vs. 43.1%, P < 0.05), while the incidence of diarrhea after EN was higher in the TEAS group (22.1% vs. 7.7%, P < 0.05). There were no significantly differences in AGI grade reduction rate, post-EN vomiting/gastric retention rate, incidence of feeding interruption, and 28-day survival rate between the two groups. Furthermore, there were no significantly interaction between these observation measures and AGI. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that there was no significantly difference in 28-day cumulative survival rate between the TEAS group and the control group [Log-Rank test: P = 0.501, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.81, 95%CI was 0.43-1.51), and there was no significantly interaction with AGI (P = 0.702).\n\nThe advantage of TEAS in the treatment of ICU patients with severe gastrointestinal function injury lies in its ability to reverse intestinal cell necrosis and promote the reconstruction of intestinal barrier function. Additionally, gastrointestinal tolerance is significantly improved, and both the duration and total calories of EN are increased. However, the limitation of TEAS therapy is that it does not promote the recovery of intestinal cell absorption and synthesis function in the target patients. Moreover, it may lead to nutrient solution overload due to improved gastrointestinal tolerance. Furthermore, TEAS does not appear to improve 28-day cumulative survival rate in the target patients.",

ISG15 mainly exerts its function through a post-translational modification process known as ISGylation.\n\nIn this study, the role of ISG15 in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and liver fibrosis was examined.\n\nLiver fibrosis was established by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), bile duct ligation (BDL) surgery and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) diet between HSC-specific deletion of ISG15 (ISG15cKO) and wild type mice. Using genetic strategies in vitro, the role of ISG15 in HSCs was established. Immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assays and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) in combination with proteomics sequencing in HSCs were used to study the associated downstream mechanisms.\n\nISG15 was underexpressed in activated HSCs and fibrotic livers, showing an inverse correlation with α-smooth muscle actin in patients with liver fibrosis. ISG15cKO mice developed spontaneous hepatic fibrosis and showed exacerbated CCl4/BDL-induced fibrogenesis. In vitro, ISG15 modulated HSC activation, proliferation and excessive extracellular matrix production. ISG15 deficiency in HSCs promoted transforming growth factorβ2 (TGFβ2) transcription by enhancing phosphorylated cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) activity, thereby inducing CREB1 binding on TGFβ2 promoter regions to activate TGFβ2/SMAD2 signalling. ISGylation directly binds CREB1 on Lys-304 and Lys-305 to inhibit p-CREB1 activity. Overexpression of ISG15 in HSCs or pharmacological inhibition of CREB1 by 666-15 could abolish ISG15 deficiency-induced liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated mice.\n\nISG15 regulated HSC activation and liver fibrosis in part via the CREB1/TGFβ2/SMAD2 regulatory pathway.

Recently, we and others reported that a high-fat, low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (KD), shown to downregulate the conventional RAAS components in rat lung and adipose tissue, can protect mice from experimental colitis. Here we assessed whether the proinflammatory angiotensin-converting enzyme - angiotensin receptor type 1 (ACE-AT1R) axis and the anti-inflammatory angiotensin-converting enzyme 2- MAS1 receptor (ACE2-MAS1) axis RAAS components are influenced by the consumption of a KD rich either in saturated fatty acids (SFA-KD) or polyunsaturated linoleic acid (LA-KD) in healthy and inflamed intestine of C57BL/6J male mice. In healthy jejunum, KD increased the AT2R protein level and decreased Ace2 level regardless of the fat source, whereas in the healthy colon, the RAAS components were unaffected by the dietary interventions. In colon, administration of 2.5 % (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 5 days upregulated ACE protein while downregulating Agtr2 gene expression. These DSS-induced changes were absent in both KD groups. Furthermore, the DSS-SFA-KD group exhibited lower angiotensinogen gene expression than the DSS animals. Additionally, LA-KD mitigated the DSS-induced decrease in Ace2 gene expression. In conclusion, intestinal RAAS component expression is influenced by KDs, and the DSS-induced upregulation of proinflammatory RAAS components were not observed in DSS-KD groups.",

The oncogenic roles of GOPC-ROS1 fusion in the formation of LMs remain unknown. This study showed that GOPC-ROS1 fusion promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs). Moreover, fusion of GOPC and ROS1 enhances the catalytic activity of the ROS1 fragment as a receptor tyrosine kinase and alters the profiling of tyrosine phosphorylation in HLECs. Multiple novel tyrosine sites phosphorylated by GOPC-ROS1 in HLECs were validated. Impaired phosphorylation of ZO-1 protein at tyrosine 895, resulting from decreased co-location of GOPC-ROS1 and ZO-1 proteins, inhibits the tight junction of HLECs, which is important for the formation of functional lymphatic vessels.

Although both JunD and miR-206 are critically involved in muscle development, their specific roles in yak skeletal muscle ontogeny remain poorly characterized, particularly regarding the regulatory axis involving miR-206-mediated targeting of JunD during myoblast proliferation and differentiation. To address this knowledge gap, this study used methods such as CCK-8, EdU, RT-qPCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, and the dual-luciferase reporter system. It was found that JunD significantly promoted the expression of cell cycle factors, such as CDK2 and PCNA, and increased cell proliferation and the proportion of S-phase cells. JunD overexpression or interference experiments demonstrated that it enhanced the differentiation and myotube formation ability of myoblasts and simultaneously upregulated the expression of key genes such as MYOG and MYOD. Additionally, the results of cell cycle detection by flow cytometry revealed that the JunD gene inhibited the apoptosis of yak myoblasts. Transcriptome analysis revealed that JunD regulated cAMP and other signaling pathways related to proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The results of the dual-luciferase reporter assay showed a good binding relationship between miR-206 and JunD. The rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-206 regulated the expression of the JunD gene, thereby exerting its influence at the transcriptional level. This study marks the first identification of JunD in yaks and clarifies its role in the development of yak myoblasts through the miR-206-JunD regulatory axis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular breeding of cattle, contributing to the basic research into the breeding and muscle development of yaks.",

Camel milk is abundant in bioactive compounds such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, and immunoglobulins, while also displaying low allergenicity, which provides an inherent advantage for functional particle preparation. Its unique nutritional profile and limited availability make it a promising resource for developing highly valuable nanoparticles (NPs). This study used camel milk as the fermentation substrate, Lactiplantibacillus paraplantarum (L. paraplantarum) LR-1 as the fermentation strain, and ultrasonic treatment for PPNP preparation. Throughout the fermentation process, the metabolic activity of the lactic acid bacteria facilitated protein-polysaccharide binding, improving the particle size, stability, and antioxidant capacity. Ultrasonic treatment further optimized the particle morphology and enhanced interfacial adsorption at the oil-water interface. The particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), contact angle analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and ζ-potential measurements. UV spectroscopy, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and in vitro antioxidant assays were also performed. The results indicated that the PPNPs exposed to ultrasonic treatment for 11 min exhibited superior antioxidant activity and stability, with particle sizes that complied with food-grade NP standards.

A total of 400 birds (200 Beldi and 200 ROSS) were reared either in intensive (10 birds/m², commercial diet) or extensive rearing systems (4 birds/m², outdoor foraging). ROSS chickens reared intensively were slaughtered at 4, 5, and 6 weeks, whereas the other experimental groups were slaughtered at 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Physico-chemical composition (dry matter, crude protein, ash , and fat content, and fatty acid (FA) profile, pH, cooking loss, color, and tenderness) were analyzed. Each experimental group included 100 birds, which were further divided into two subgroups of 50 birds each, serving as biological replicates. Data were analyzed using a mixed linear model with repeated measures on muscles. Subgroup-level analyses showed no significant differences, allowing data to be pooled for group-level comparisons. Results showed that Beldi chickens exhibited higher dry matter (28.25 vs. 25.48 %; p < 0.001) and crude protein (24.20 vs. 18.86 % FM; p < 0.001), but lower fat content (1.77 ± 0.10 % vs. 1.92 ± 0.09 % FM; p < 0.001) than ROSS chickens. Particularly in the extensive system and at later slaughter ages, Beldi chickens exhibited higher pH values across both the breast and thigh and firmer meat with higher shear force values. Under the intensive system, chicken meat was characterized by higher tenderness, lightness (L*), and yellowness (b*), but reduced redness (a*) and cooking loss, compared to the extensive system. The fatty acid (FA) profile also varied according to these factors, with meat from Beldi chickens characterized as healthier with lower SFA and MUFA content, but higher PUFA content. Moreover, according to health indices, Beldi chickens were characterized by higher PUFA/SFA, desirable fatty acids (DFA), essential fatty acids (EFA), and LA/ALA, and a lower thrombogenic index (TI) than ROSS chickens. Meat from the extensive system was characterized by higher total SFA and MUFA and lower PUFA. In summary, Beldi chickens, particularly when reared under extensive systems, produced meat with enhanced nutritional quality, whereas ROSS broilers provided more tender meat.

In vitro, treatment with 5 mM fructose increased the size of intestinal organoids from broilers (P < 0.05). For in vivo trial, 96 one-day-old male AA broilers with similar body weights were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups (control and fructose) with 6 replicates of 8 birds each. All birds received the same commercial diet, with the control group receiving tap water and the fructose group receiving 1 % fructose in water for 42 days. Fructose supplementation had no effects on body weight, feed intake or FCR throughout the trial (P > 0.05). It increased the dressed percentage of the broilers (P < 0.05), without affecting other carcass characteristics or abdominal fat index. Apparent digestibility of dietary crude fat was reduced by fructose (P < 0.05), while crude protein digestibility remained unchanged (P > 0.05). However, fructose enhanced hepatic lipids synthesis, as evidenced by upregulated expression of ACC1 and Srebf1 (P < 0.05) and suppressed fatty acids oxidation through reduced CPT1 expression and lower serum palmitoylcarnitine levels (P < 0.05). Liver inflammation was also increased, indicated by elevated expression of IL-1β and higher serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators such as 5-HETE (P < 0.05). Fructose improved intestinal morphology, including increased villus height to crypt depth ratio and lengthening of the duodenum and ileum (P < 0.05). Tight junction gene expression was also upregulated, indicating enhanced barrier integrity. Fructose influenced the intestinal microbiota and serum metabolites of broilers. Gut microbiota composition was altered by fructose, as shown by significant differences in microbial structure (ANOSIM, P < 0.05). Fructose reduced the relative abundance of Firmicutes while increasing Bacteroidota, resulting in a lower Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidota ratio (P < 0.05). Enrichment analysis showed fructose-associated bacteria were positively correlated with intestinal morphology, while control-associated taxa were linked to fat metabolism. Serum metabolomics analysis revealed distinct clustering between groups, with differentially abundant metabolites (VIP > 1, P < 0.05) enriched in lipid metabolic pathways. In conclusion, supplementation with 1% fructose via drinking water enhanced intestinal development and microbial composition in broilers without affecting growth performance. However, it reduced dietary fat digestibility and induced hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation. These findings suggest the need for further research to optimize its use for promoting gut health without compromising liver function or nutrient utilization.",

There is limited evidence in the current medical literature to determine whether a vegan diet is adequate for children, since the currently available society position papers are based on narrative reviews and expert opinion. Updated evidence-based recommendations are needed to guide clinical practice. This position paper presents findings from a literature review performed using a systematic search strategy, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We analyzed the current evidence on the effect of vegan diet compared to omnivorous diet on body growth, nutritional adequacy and laboratory biomarkers in infants, children and adolescents. Observational studies, cohort studies and clinical trials published over the last 15 years in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were retrieved. Our position paper aims to update the evidence for or against the adequacy of a vegan diet in infants, children and adolescents and to provide evidence-based recommendations. A total of 10 articles were accepted and included in the final review, providing information on approximately 1500 children following a vegan diet. Several articles assessed more than one outcome: seven addressed body growth, five evaluated nutritional adequacy and five examined laboratory biomarkers. To complement the primary data, three systematic reviews and meta-analyses were also included. Current evidence is inconclusive to determine whether a strictly vegan diet supports normal childhood growth, although no significant differences in height or body mass index z-scores were observed compared to omnivorous peers. We recommend that dietary intake, growth and nutritional status should be regularly monitored in vegan children. Focusing on dietary intakes (e.g., protein, omega-3, calcium and iron) and ensuring supplementation with specific micronutrients, including vitamin B12, is essential during paediatric age when following a strict vegan diet. Clinical research, well-designed prospective studies and high-quality trials are required to address current research gaps.",

    "combined_text": "Is There Conservation of Vitellogenins in a Placentotrophic Lizard?\n\nIn vertebrates, the provision of nutrients to developing embryos varies widely, ranging from yolk-dependent strategies to highly specialized forms of placental nourishment. Vitellogenins (VTGs) are essential proteins for egg yolk formation in oviparous and lecithotrophic species. In contrast, in eutherian mammals, the loss of VTGs is associated with the evolution of matrotrophy (placentotrophy and lactation), where maternal nutrition via the placenta replaces the need for large yolk reserves during embryonic development. Marisora sp., a placentotrophic viviparous lizard with the most complex placenta known in reptiles, exhibits truncated vitellogenesis, resulting in the production of microlecithal eggs. This study investigated the presence of VTGs in Marisora sp. using RNA-seq from the liver and ovary at previtellogenesis and vitellogenesis stages. No corresponding annotations for VTGs were found. This absence may be associated with the placentotrophic nutrition of the embryo, suggesting modifications in lipid production and transport to the ovarian follicles. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and microsomal triglyceride transfer proteins (MTP) were identified, which are closely related to VTGs and could fulfill their function, especially ApoB, which is involved in yolk formation in lecithotrophic species in which VTGs are absent. The absence of VTGs in the Marisora sp. transcriptome represents a key discovery in the evolution of obligate placentotrophic viviparity in reptiles, highlighting convergent traits with mammals. Genomic studies are required to determine if changes in VTG genes prevent or modify their expression, and proteomic studies are needed to fully understand the role of other lipid transport proteins in the preovulatory ovarian follicles of these lizards.",

    "combined_text": "\"Expression of the Peroxisome Proliferators-Activated Receptors (PPARs) in ex vivo arterial tissue of patients with abdominal aneurysms and its association with wall remodeling and inflammatory gene expression\".\n\nThe pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is multifactorial, characterized by complex pathophysiological processes, including cytokine secretion and protease-mediated degradation of the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM). Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of genes for metabolic enzymes and cytokines. However, the molecular mechanisms of PPARs on vascular physiology are not fully evaluated. Our objective was to assess the association between the expression of PPARs in ex vivo aortic tissue ant the gene expression of markers of arterial remodeling and inflammation.\n\nTwo aortic tissue samples were obtained from 20 patients [mean age 69 years, standard deviation (SD) 5] who underwent open AAA repair. One from the aneurysmal sac and other from nondiseased adjacent aortic tissue. Four micrometers (μm) sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson for histopathologic evaluation and arterial wall thickness morphometry. Total Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and retrotranscribed to determine PPARs, matrix remodeling proteins and cytokine gene expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific forward and reverse oligonucleotides and SybrGreen master mix. Statistical analysis was conducted using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test in Prism 8 for Mac (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nAneurysm biopsies demonstrated loss of smooth muscle cells, and fragmented and disorganized elastic fibers and changes in extracellular matrix composition. The expression of PPARα, PPARδ and PPARγ was significantly lower in the aneurysmal aorta compared to nondiseased control tissue from the same patients (59%, 61% and 42% respectively, p<0.01). The expression of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP4 was significantly reduced in the aneurysmal tissue compared to control (64%), while that of the ECM-degrading enzyme cathepsin S was 7-fold higher in the aneurysmal aortic tissue (p<0.01). Gene expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and the cytokines TNFα and IL-1β was significantly upregulated in aneurysmal tissue compared to control nondiseased tissue (20-fold, 83-fold and 18-fold, respectively, p<0.001).\n\nThese results confirm an inverse correlation between PPARs gene expression and inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, along with an unfavorable arterial remodeling gene expression. The decrease in the expression of the three PPAR isoforms in the aortic tissue appears to promote abnormal arterial remodeling and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to wall thinning and AAA progression.",

It also functions as an inflammatory mediator and triggers caspase-3, which causes brain damage. The purpose of this study was to unveil the phytochemical richness of macadamia nut oil (MO) and assess its potential as a treatment for brain damage caused by potassium dichromate (PDC), as well as its impact on galectin-3/caspase-3 and Sitruin1. The active ingredients of MO were determined by thorough analyses using GC-MS, HPLC, and spectrophotometry. These included oleic acid (47.53 %), palmitoleic acid (16.48 %), squalene, β-sitosterol, seven phenolic compounds (catechol being the most prevalent), and vital vitamins, particularly vitamin K (11.07 mg/ml). Both saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions of MO demonstrate strong antioxidant qualities, efficiently scavenging DPPH and ABTS radicals. By restoring Nrf2 and SIRT1 levels and reducing keap1, MAPK, ERK, galectin-3, and caspase-3 levels in the brain, the oil successfully mitigated PDC-induced brain damage. Furthermore, MO significantly reduced the immune-expression of caspase-3 and GFAP in the cerebellar cortex. These discoveries establish MO as a potent natural neuroprotective agent, paving the way for novel pharmaceutical approaches to treat neurodegenerative illnesses and improve brain function. Moreover, this study establishes a viable path for improving cognitive wellness and promoting general neurological health by creating functional meals and nutritional supplements enhanced with this beneficial oil.",

Traditional nutritional research is often hampered by environmental variability, low precision, and the complexity of nutrient interactions across different tissues. The advent of high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics, and functional genomics has driven the rapid emergence of various omics fields, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics. These technologies overcome the limitations of traditional research methods, becoming powerful tools for investigating the regulatory mechanisms of nutrition in aquatic animals. Genomics and transcriptomics reveal genetic responses of aquatic animals to nutritional interventions, while proteomics and metabolomics enable large-scale analysis of proteins and metabolites, illuminating physiological changes under various nutritional conditions. Moreover, microbiomics provides crucial insights into the interactions between gut microbiota and host nutrient metabolism and immunity. Key applications such as gene editing and protein post-translational modification analysis further elucidate molecular mechanisms of nutritional regulation in fish. Despite significant advances, omics still faces persistent challenges, including technological complexity, ethical concerns, underdeveloped regulatory systems, ecological safety risks, and issues related to data storage and sharing. Addressing these through technological innovation, improved regulatory frameworks, and the expansion of application areas will be crucial for the sustainable advancement of omics in aquatic animal nutrition research.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the wheat bZIP transcription factor TabZIP156 plays a vital role in enhancing drought tolerance. However, the drought tolerance mechanism of TabZIP156 in wheat remains unclear. In this study, TaJAZ3-2 A was identified as an interactor of TabZIP156 through yeast two-hybrid screening. This interaction was confirmed in vivo using luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and further validated in vitro by GST pull-down experiments. The LCI assays showed that the C-terminal domain of TabZIP156 interacted with the N-terminal domain of TaJAZ3-2 A. Transcription level analysis revealed that TaJAZ3-2 A was predominantly expressed in roots, and exhibited significant response to PEG-induced drought, ABA, and MeJA stress. Subcellular localization analysis showed that TaJAZ3-2 A was localized to the nucleus. Functional studies revealed that TaJAZ3-2 A overexpressing Arabidopsis displayed reduced drought tolerance. Conversely, virus-induced gene silencing of TaJAZ3-2 A in wheat showed enhanced drought tolerance and upregulated key stress-responsive and antioxidant-related genes. Moreover, the dual-luciferase assays showed that TaJAZ3-2 A and TabZIP156 mutually antagonize each other in regulating the expression levels of TaP5CS, TaDREB1A, and TaPOD. In conclusion, these findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of TabZIP156 in wheat drought tolerance and establish a theoretical foundation for the development of drought-tolerant wheat cultivars.",

Seaweeds increased the intake, transfer efficiency, and milk concentration of I. Seaweeds increased the intake of As, but highly toxic trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb) were not found in milk on any treatment. Milk I concentration was very low, especially in RSC-CON (38 µg/kg), possibly due to the unexpectedly high glucosinolate concentration (48 mmol/kg DM) of rapeseed. Milk I concentration on MFP-CON and I transfer efficiency on all pea diets were also lower than usual. In conclusion, pea diets resulted in more favorable milk I concentration for human consumers than rapeseed high in glucosinolates.",

Based on the dielectric spectrum, detection models were constructed using partial least squares (PLS), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, and an optimized CNN-LSTM fused with the crested porcupine optimizer (CPO) and squeeze-and-excitation network (CPO-CNN-LSTM-SEN) for camel milk quality detection. The results indicate that across the 0.1 to 26.5 GHz frequency range, ε' exhibits a gradual decreasing trend with increasing frequency, and ε\" demonstrates an initial decrease followed by an increase. Both ε' and ε\" decrease with elevated fat, protein, and lactose content, showing strong negative correlations. Among CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM achieved optimal performance in discriminating camel milk adulteration with water and similar species milk (e.g., cow, goat, and mixed milk), attaining a 100% discrimination rate.

Therefore, a targeted metabolomics approach combined with an examination of classical clinical chemistry using plasma samples was used to describe the metabolic status 42 days before expected calving and at day 21 of lactation. In total, 27 multiparous cows (HF n = 17, SI n = 10) were enrolled in the study. All cows were kept on the same farm under identical management, feeding and housing conditions. BW of HF cows dropped while SI cows maintained their BW but produced less milk than HF cows during the first weeks of lactation. Differences were detected for the following indicators and related pathways, and were used to assess their biological impact. Branched-chain amino acids such as leucine and isoleucine at day +21 remained as high as at day -42 in HF cows; however, in SI cows, a clear drop in these amino acids was observed indicating less body protein mobilisation in this breed. Alpha amino-adipic acid and kynurenine as markers for oxidative stress balance were increased at day +21 in HF cows, only reflecting a metabolically more tensed condition in HF cows.

Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis identified more pronounced transcriptomic changes under chronic HS (heart: 2,503 DEGs; liver: 2,236 DEGs) compared to acute HS (heart: 1,217 DEGs; liver: 1,843 DEGs).

Although ongoing studies are investigating the relationship between various salivary proteins and dental caries, consensus in existing literature has not yet been established. This study aims to provide additional insights into the current research of salivary protein biomarkers association with dental caries.\n\nThis systematic review analyzed literature published between January 2013 to December 2023, retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science.\n\nThe review included 21 observational studies (2 cohort, 2 case-control, and 17 cross-sectional) involving over 2,000 participants, examining 18 different proteins. There was considerable variability in the types of salivary markers studied. Among the participants, 54% were diagnosed as caries-active (CA), while 45.9% were caries-free (CF), with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years.

However, larger and greater designed studies are needed to establish their clinical value. Besides, divergent results from proteomic studies on biomarkers may be due to variations in genetics, diet, oral hygiene, age and other factors of the subjects, which could affect the reliability of saliva biomarkers in caries screening and detection.

Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), one of the main active ingredients in the Chinese herbal Astragalus film, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasoprotective pharmacological activities. Therefore, we hypothesized that AS-IV may induce the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hJBMMSCs), which is key to its potential application in the regeneration and repair of oral and maxillofacial bone tissue defects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of AS-IV on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hJBMMSCs and the mechanisms involved. In this in vitro study, the cytotoxicity of AS-IV to hJBMMSCs was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated via alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium nodule formation, osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression, and osteogenic protein levels. In addition, the potential molecular mechanism underlying AS-IV-induced osteogenic differentiation of hJBMMSCs was preliminarily explored using LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT antagonist. AS-IV significantly promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hJBMMSCs at tested concentrations. Notably, treatment with 40 µM AS-IV supplemented in differentiation medium significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and mineral deposition. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR revealed that 40 µM AS-IV increased the expression of osteogenic and angiogenic genes such as ALP, Runx2, OPN, OCN, CD31, VEGF, and Ang-1 in hJBMMSCs. Western blot analysis further showed that 40 µM AS-IV upregulated the levels of the osteogenic proteins Runx-2 and OCN. These effects may be mediated by AS-IV through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Overall, AS-IV promotes hJBMMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and upregulating osteogenic and angiogenesis-related genes.",

The present work aims at the assessment of the potential protection afforded by grape seed extract (GSE) on the rat cardiac proteome using a proteomic approach. Using a rodent model of obesity, we performed a comparative quantitative proteomic approach of heart samples from standard, high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD+GSE groups. LTQ OrbiTrap technology, followed by bioinformatic tools, allowed the identification of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). GSE alleviated the HFD-induced energy metabolism alteration by recovering and/or enhancing some DAPs, such as the aconitase and the propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Also, GSE renews the capacity of cardiomyocytes to produce energy by an overabundance of complex I and complex III. Additionally, GSE improved the contractile function and alleviated cardiomyopathy in obesity following an overabundance of key contractile proteins like myosins and actinin. This study demonstrates that GSE confers cardioprotective effects in the context of obesity-induced metabolic disturbances. Through a proteomic approach, we identified key DAPs involved in energy metabolism and contractile function that were positively modulated by GSE.

In this work, a fast stress relaxing, boronate ester-based synthetic hydrogel is used for the culture of intestinal organoids, and it is fortuitously discovered that unlike all other synthetic hydrogels to date, laminin does not need to be supplemented for crypt formation. This highly defined material provides a unique opportunity to investigate laminin-organoid interactions and how it influences crypt evolution and organoid function. Via fluorescent labeling of non-canonical amino acids, it is further shown that adaptable boronate ester bonds increase deposition of nascent proteins, including laminin.

Protein hydrolysis had little effect on starch retrogradation and digestibility, showing no change in the crystallinity, retrogradation enthalpy change and extent of digestion, compared to the cooked sample.

This study presents a case report based on clinical and nutritional data extracted from the electronic medical record of a 1-year and 10-month-old male infant diagnosed with HLHS, hospitalized in a tertiary cardiology hospital while awaiting a heart transplant. The length of hospitalization while waiting for the organ was approximately 13 months. Upon hospital admission, the child presented with severe malnutrition according to the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards. Thus, the decision was made to initiate enteral nutritional therapy in combination with an oral diet. Despite being complementary, the enteral nutritional intake ranged from 35 to 100 kcal/kg/d and 1.6 to 2.7 g of protein/kg/d. As a result, the child presented progressive weight gain, reaching normal values, as per World Health Organization growth standards, by the time of transplantation. Although limited, there was also an improvement in the child's length-for-age metric. Physical examination also revealed other improvements, such as in hair pigmentation and recovery of body reserves. Most notably, the child had a satisfactory recovery following heart transplant surgery. Therefore, it appears that the nutritional therapy applied was effective in improving the nutritional status of a child with severe malnutrition, which may have contributed to the surgical success and good postoperative recovery. Children with HLHS may benefit from alternative feeding methods to achieve higher nutritional intake.",

The function of the XK protein and the disease pathophysiology remain poorly understood. We report a unique case of MLS presenting with exercise intolerance due to isolated myopathy associated with mitochondrial Complex I deficiency, in the absence of central nervous system involvement or neuropathy. Whole-genome sequencing identified a novel in-frame duplication introducing an additional leucine at a highly conserved site within the transmembrane domain of the XK protein, resulting in impaired XK protein expression. This case expands the phenotypic spectrum of MLS and underscores the need to include MLS in the differential diagnosis of unexplained metabolic myopathies.

The present study aimed to elucidate the evolutionary history and physiological functions of TRP genes (TRPs) in E. sinensis through a combination of phylogenetic analyses and transcriptomic approaches. The evolutionary analysis revealed a significant expansion of the TRPA subfamily in arthropods. Sequence analysis and codon usage bias assessment further indicated that TRPs exhibit a certain degree of conservation between E. sinensis and its closely related species, suggesting they are likely subject to evolutionary selective pressures. To investigate the physiological roles of TRPs in E. sinensis, we conducted transcriptomic analysis of TRPs across different tissues, molting stages of the hepatopancreas, and ovarian developmental stages. The results showed that TRPA genes were highly expressed in the gills, hindgut, and midgut, suggesting a potential involvement in immune response. The significant overexpression of TRP and TRPL in the eyestalk implied their possible role in phototransduction. High expression of TRPs was observed in the hepatopancreas during various molting stages. Additionally, TRPC genes were highly expressed at different ovarian developmental stages. Overall, this study revealed the evolutionary dynamics of TRPs in E. sinensis and provided preliminary evidence for their potential regulatory roles in tissue function, molting, and ovarian maturation, with further experimental validation required in the future.",

Nevertheless, the suboptimal extraction rate and inefficiencies associated with conventional collagen processing posed significant barriers to its widespread application. Recent advances have spurred interest in the utilization of the ultrasound (US) technology as means to improve collagen extraction processes. The ultrasound can be presented as a highly effective method for auxiliary collagen extraction, characterized by substantial yield, enhanced extraction efficiency, and the preservation of the functional activity. Ultrasound treatment can facilitate improvement in both solubility and molecular structure of collagen, thereby promoting its functional properties. This review aims to elucidate ultrasound-assisted methods aimed at optimizing collagen extraction efficiency, while also exploring the intricate relationship between ultrasound processing parameters and collagen yield. Furthermore, it examines the correlation between collagen structural attributes and its functional efficacy. Moreover, the review delineates the advantages of the ultrasound-assisted methods in the extraction of collagen peptides and addresses the current challenges along with the perspective trends in ultrasonic applications. Notably, ultrasonic cavitation partially unfolds collagen, enhancing its efficacy when synergistically applied with other extraction techniques. Therefore, the advancement of ultrasonic equipment and the optimization of processing conditions are crucial for the innovation of collagen-based functional foods.",

    "combined_text": "Parthenolide inhibits Hsp90α ATPase activity and overcomes acquired BRAF-inhibitor resistance in cutaneous melanoma.\n\nOncogenic mutations in the BRAF gene, particularly the V600E mutation, are present in roughly half of metastatic cutaneous melanoma cases. BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) have shown significant clinical efficacy; however, their long-term effectiveness is frequently limited by the development of resistance. Parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone derived from medicinal herbs, has previously been reported to exhibit anti-melanoma effects and to disrupt signaling pathways associated with BRAFi resistance.\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the potential of parthenolide to overcome resistance to BRAFi in melanoma.\n\nThe effects of parthenolide on BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells were assessed using cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle assays. In vivo efficacy and safety were evaluated in a BRAFi-resistant melanoma xenograft mouse model. Target identification and validation were performed using network pharmacology, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance, and Western blotting.\n\nParthenolide inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle arrest in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. In vivo, parthenolide significantly suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor weight in BRAFi-resistant melanoma xenografts without apparent toxicity. Mechanistically, parthenolide stably interacted with the N-terminal ATPase domain of Hsp90α and dose-dependently inhibited its ATPase activity. Hsp90α functions as a chaperone for several oncoproteins involved in signaling pathways driving BRAFi resistance. Parthenolide reduced the levels of several Hsp90α client proteins and inhibited their downstream pathways, including PI3K/Akt, Ras/Raf/MEK, and Src/STAT3, in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. Moreover, the Hsp90 activator tamoxifen attenuated the effects of parthenolide in these cells.\n\nOur findings provide the first evidence that parthenolide can overcome BRAFi resistance in melanoma, highlighting its potential as a lead compound for the development of Hsp90α inhibitors to manage BRAFi-resistant cutaneous melanoma.",

Here, we investigated whether SNCA is regulated in vivo by the RNA-binding protein PUM1. We establish that PUM1 binds to SNCA's 3' UTR in mouse and human cells. In induced neurons from patients with SNCA locus triplication, PUM1 mRNA levels are lower than in healthy controls, but increasing PUM1 normalizes both SNCA mRNA and α-synuclein protein levels, largely by suppressing the long 3' UTR SNCA isoform. In microfluidic chamber experiments, silencing PUM1 causes a redistribution of SNCA between the soma and axons. We also show that the previously described miR-7 regulation of SNCA mRNA requires PUM1. Lastly, we report finding several individuals with PD in clinical databases bearing variants in PUM1 that affect its RNA-binding ability. Understanding how RNA-binding proteins regulate α-synuclein could lead to viable new therapies for synucleinopathies.",

This study deciphered their interfacial stability mechanism through integrated lipidomics and nanomechanical characterization. Untargeted lipidomics identified 35 lipid subclasses, revealing triacylglyceride (65.91%) as the core lipid. A comparative analysis with commercial oil uncovered 287 significantly different lipid species and signature interfacial phospholipids, PA (33:0), PS (38:4), and PC (34:2). Unsaturated fatty acids, accounting for 82.49% of the total composition, enhanced interfacial membrane fluidity, while abundant bioactive components such as vitamin E (19.2 mg/100 g), γ-oryzanol (0.67%), and sterols (1153 mg/100 g) conferred oxidative stability. The predominance of hydrophilic amino acids facilitates colloidal stability and digestibility. Dominant interfacial proteins oleosin 16 and oleosin 18 kDa feature tripartite structural domains and demonstrated spontaneous C-terminal binding to PA/PS/PC via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, forming a stable interfacial structure. The interfacial membrane consisted of a 7.47 nm phospholipid-oleosin monolayer and stable multilayers (66.98 nm). Atomic force microscopy with a colloidal probe confirmed superior mechanical properties compared to conventional oilseed OBs, with a stiffness of 0.0133 ± 0.0023 N/m and a Young's modulus of 92.09 ± 4.75 MPa.

Participants were recruited via consecutive sampling and randomly assigned to receive synbiotics (comprising 4 probiotic strains and 1 prebiotic) or placebo daily for 42 days. Inflammatory status was assessed through the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Fat and muscle mass were measured using a Karada Scan Omron. Anorexia was evaluated with the FAACT-A/CS questionnaire, and fatigue with the FACIT-F questionnaire. Functional capacity was determined through hand grip strength (HGS) using a Camry dynamometer. Data were collected pre and post-intervention and analyzed using an independent t-test (or Mann-Whitney test) for continuous data and chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) for categorical data.

Threonine in T1 of the reduced Alb ratio was significantly lower than that in T2-3 in the second trimester.\n\nIndividual FAA concentrations during pregnancy are affected differently according to the dietary protein source and intake. The intake of animal proteins is effective in maintaining essential FAAs during pregnancy. Protein deficiency may lead to decreased concentrations of serum tryptophan, threonine, and protein nutritional biomarkers. Identifying a proper strategy for ensuring adequate protein intake may contribute to healthy birth outcomes.\n\nInadequate protein intake decreases serum free amino acid concentrations, leading to poor overall nutritional status and poor pregnancy outcomes. Animal protein intake and reduced albumin, a novel indicator of protein nutrition, were significantly associated with serum tryptophan and threonine concentrations. Animal protein intake is effective in maintaining essential free amino acid concentrations during pregnancy and may contribute to healthy birth outcomes.

In this study, we investigated the functional role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Membrane-Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 5 (MARCH5) in regulating cell growth, metabolic reprogramming and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM) through the negative regulation of the mitochondrial fusion driver mitofusin 2 (MFN2).\n\nCell viability and apoptosis were evaluated in MM cell lines or in co-culture with stromal cells using the CellTiter-Glo® Cell Viability Assay and Annexin V/7-AAD staining, respectively. Clonogenic potential was assessed using methylcellulose-based colony formation assays. Protein stability was determined via cycloheximide chase experiments, while protein-protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Oxygen consumption was measured using high-resolution respirometry in live cells. Transcriptomic profiling was performed using the Illumina NGS platform, and mRNA and protein levels were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. In vivo anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated in NOD-SCID mice subcutaneously engrafted with MM cells, using an MFN2-inducible model or following intraperitoneal administration of leflunomide. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze tumor xenografts and mouse organs.\n\nKnockdown of MARCH5 led to a pronounced elongation of mitochondria accompanied by increased expression of MFN2, likely resulting from reduced MARCH5-mediated ubiquitylation. Functionally, silencing MARCH5 impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and reduced ATP production, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in MM cells. Notably, similar phenotypic and functional effects were observed following either genetic overexpression or pharmacological activation of MFN2 using leflunomide, both in vitro and in vivo in a murine xenograft model of MM. Transcriptomic profiling of MARCH5-depleted cells revealed downregulation of gene sets associated with mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthesis, pathways implicated in the development of venetoclax resistance. Consistently, both MARCH5 knockdown and MFN2 upregulation enhanced the sensitivity of MM cells to venetoclax.\n\nShifting mitochondrial dynamics toward fusion by targeting the MARCH5-MFN2 axis impairs ETC and OXPHOS, thereby sensitizing MM cells to venetoclax. These findings provide preclinical evidence for the potential therapeutic use of MFN2 inducers to enhance venetoclax responsiveness of MM patients.",

It is characterised by onset of cardiac structural and functional impairments and can lead to direct development of clinical heart failure (HF) or predispose to hypertensive/ischaemic stress. DbCM is a complex disease which involves several metabolic and pathogenic factors. We characterised an established high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced DbCM model incorporating typical features of human disease to determine its suitability for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutics prior to advancement to human trials. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomised to HFD and single-dose STZ (100 mg/kg) or control diet (CD) and vehicle. HFD/STZ mice developed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), reflected by high fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels, reduced β-cell function, and increased insulin resistance without systolic blood pressure alteration. Furthermore, HFD/STZ mice displayed progressive diastolic dysfunction, evidenced by decreased MV E/A ratio, together with elevated chronic left ventricular (LV) filling pressure parameters, measured by left atrial (LA) area and LA volume, compared to controls, in parallel with LV hypertrophy and fibrosis. Monocyte trafficking into diabetic hearts was identified by single-nuclei RNA sequencing analysis, which revealed an interferon-α response in DbCM mice, whilst plasma proteomics confirmed the involvement of inflammatory processes with elevated plasma C-reactive protein in DbCM progression. Taken together, our HFD/STZ-induced DbCM model exhibits a unique DbCM pre-clinical phenotype reflecting a \"triple-hit\" of human DbCM features comprising (1) T2DM with insulin resistance, (2) progressive diastolic dysfunction and LV remodelling, and (3) metabolic inflammation. This improved HFD/STZ-induced DbCM model supports clinically relevant research on DbCM progression from early stages to cardiac dysfunction and remodelling as the basis for translational investigation.",

This study prepared casein hydrolysate with valid GABA-T inhibitory activity using ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis and obtained novel GABA-T inhibitory peptides through isolation and purification. The results demonstrated that ultrasonic pretreatment significantly improved the casein hydrolysis efficiency, enhanced GABA-T inhibitory activity by 19.32%, and allowed retention of 42.37% of the initial inhibitory activity after gastrointestinal digestion. Through peptidomics analysis, five novel GABA-T inhibitory peptides were identified from casein hydrolysate, including FFVAPFPE, VYPFPGPIPN, HLPLPL, FLPYPY, and WQVL (2.79 ± 0.14 to 8.49 ± 0.26 mM). Molecular docking results revealed that these five peptides bind to GABA-T through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, with the Arg422 residue potentially serving as the key active site for GABA-T inhibition.

We also show that hepatic knockout of G3BP1 promotes de novo lipogenesis, and ultimately found that G3BP1 is required for the nuclear translocation of the well-known liver-lipid-regulating transcription factor TFE3.

    "combined_text": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor: A promising target for intestinal fibrosis therapy.\n\nIntestinal fibrosis, a severe complication of inflammatory bowel disease, leads to intestinal stenosis. Effective therapies for this condition are lacking. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a highly conserved nuclear transcription factor activated by diverse ligands, plays dual roles in fibrogenesis, but its relationship to intestinal fibrosis has not been comprehensively reviewed. This review explores the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis, and places particular focus on the mechanistic role of AhR signaling pathways, which may be mediated by dietary, microbial, and environmental ligands. We propose a new strategy for the targeting of AhR-related dietary ligands to prevent intestinal fibrosis. Dietary AhR ligands, such as glucobrassicin, flavonoids, and curcumin, exert anti-fibrotic effects by modulating the gut microbiota, suppressing collagen deposition, and inhibiting transforming growth factor-β pathways. Conversely, environmental pollutants (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, microplastics, and propiconazole) exacerbate fibrosis via AhR activation. In multiple disease models, 16S rRNA sequencing has revealed positive and negative linear relationships between the gut microbiota and fibrosis. Intestinal microbiota-derived metabolites also affect fibrosis, including via immune cell regulation to indirectly reduce collagen deposition and direct action on extracellular matrix-related proteins to relieve intestinal fibrosis. The interaction among the AhR, microbiota, and diet suggests new therapeutic strategies, such as dietary interventions and fecal microbiota transplantation, to restore the microbial balance and inhibit fibrosis. The promotion of intestinal fibrosis by AhR agonists in environmental pollutants further emphasizes the need to reduce exposure to environmental toxins while following a plant-based diet rich in AhR agonists.",

In this study, a type III HSP40 (PtHSP40-III) that mainly expresses in the thoracic ganglion of Portunus trituberculatus is identified. Despite PtHSP40-III shows relatively lower transcriptional level in hemocyte, its transcripts could be significantly induced by Vibrio alginolyticus. The recombinant protein of PtHSP40-III displays binding activity toward both Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN). Meanwhile, PtHSP40-III could act as extracellular ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) via directly interacting with the leucine-rich repeats (LRR) domain of TLR. PtHSP40-III can promote the nuclear translocation of Dorsal as well as specifically regulate the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) and crustin. Furthermore, PtHSP40-III enhances the hemocyte phagocytosis against V. alginolyticus.

Moreover, SBO was more effective than BO in this regard.\n\nThese findings suggest that SBO more effectively mitigates hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation in rats fed HF diet, a phenomenon partly related to the increased activation of AMPK and SIRT1. This indicates that SBO may provide greater benefits than BO in improving lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses.",

Body weight (BW) and relative food intake (rFI) were measured daily. Body composition, naso-anal length (NAL), energy expenditure, and plasma FGF-21 were measured at the end of the deficiency and supplementation phases. Data were analyzed using one way or Mixed-model ANOVA and Bonferonni tests for multiple comparisons.\n\nAll the deficient diets induced growth retardation (lower BW, lean body mass (LBM) and NAL) with threonine deficiency having the most severe effect (60% lower BW of Ctr, p<0,001). Supplementation induced a resumption of growth, but BW and LBM remained lower (15 to 35% for BW and 69 to 84% for LBM of Ctr, p<0,001 Despite increased rFI, no excess adiposity was observed post-supplementation in P20 and T100 groups, likely due to increased energy expenditure (p<0.001). In L100 and M100 groups, rFI increased (by 35% and 30%, respectively, p<0.001) without a corresponding rise in energy expenditure. FGF-21 was inversely associated with the protein and IAA status during both deficiency and supplementation (p<0,001).\n\nThese findings highlight the distinct roles of individual IAAs in growth and metabolic recovery and suggest that targeted AAI supplementation may improve nutritional interventions.",

Understanding the dynamics of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in septic patients, particularly those with AKI, could improve the monitoring and prediction of renal outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate fluctuations in oxidative stress and antioxidant capacities in septic patients with and without AKI at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and one week later. In addition, it sought to investigate the potential correlation between specific oxidative stress and antioxidant markers and renal outcomes.\n\nA cross-sectional and follow-up study was conducted, involving 124 critically ill septic patients. The patients were divided into groups according to the presence of AKI at admission to the ICU. Epidemiological, clinical data, and biochemical measurements of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity were collected on days 1 and 7 of ICU admission.\n\nThe results indicated that plasma concentrations of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were significantly higher in patients with AKI on both evaluation days. Notable differences in antioxidant capacities, including plasma glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase, were observed between the two groups. In patients with AKI, plasma oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity demonstrated a close relationship. Specifically, plasma GSH concentrations on day 1 were correlated with increased odds of major adverse kidney events within 14 and 28 days (MAKE14 and MAKE28), while elevated plasma GPx activities on day 7 were associated with reduced odds of MAKE14 and MAKE28.\n\nMonitoring plasma GSH concentrations on the 1st day of ICU admission, in conjunction with the evaluation of plasma GPx activities on the 7th day, may serve as pivotal indicators for predicting renal outcomes in critically septic patients.",

Because of the diversity of pathogen effector repertoires, NLRs have extraordinary sequence, structural, and regulatory variability. Although processes contributing to NLR diversity have been identified, the precise evolution of NLRs in their genomic context and along the multiple axes of diversity has been difficult to trace. We integrate genome-specific full-length transcript, homology, and transposable element information to annotate 3,789 NLRs in 17 diverse Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We define 121 pangenomic NLR neighborhoods, which vary greatly in size, content, and complexity. NLRs are diverse across many axes, and multiple metrics are required to fully capture NLR variation. Based on these findings, we propose that diversity in diversity generation is fundamental to maintaining a functionally \"adaptive\" immune system in plants and that mechanistic studies should consider multiple axes of immune system diversity.",

To fill this gap, this study analyzed comprehensive datasets from 2004 to 2024, covering 4840 patent applications, 170 drug pipelines, 123 clinical trials, and 44 licensing transactions, characterizing global trends, geographic distributions, collaborations, therapeutic landscapes, key targets, and stakeholder dynamics. From 2023 to 2024, clinical trials increased by 57 %, patent families by 28 %, collaborative patents by 87 %, and new patent entrants by 28 %. The U.S. and China dominate global PROTAC competition, with the U.S. leading in patent strength and new entrants, and China advancing rapidly in clinical translation and early-stage pipelines. Although licensing activities initially peaked in 2020, a rationalized decline followed. PROTAC targets have diversified from classical oncology proteins to include previously \"undruggable\" oncology, immunology, and neurology targets. Among the top 15 patent assignees by patent family count, 11 are pharmaceutical companies, of which 9 have advanced at least one clinical-stage PROTAC pipeline candidate into global leadership, although some programs have since been discontinued. This study fills a critical gap by providing systematic competitive intelligence analysis, complementing existing PROTAC reviews that mainly address molecular mechanisms and technical challenges.

Though essential for cardiovascular homeostasis, the effects of SIRT6-mediated lysine myristoylation on CVDs progression remain largely unexplored due to detection limitations. This study developes an innovative lysine-myristoylated peptide enrichment technique, identifying mutant SIRT6 (H133Y) with high myristoyl affinity but deficient demyristoylase activity. This advancement enables identification of 15 previously unrecognized human lysine-myristoylated proteins. Further study demonstrates that SIRT6 demyristoylates activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) at K296 and regulates its nucleoplasmic translocation. Through 4D label-free mass spectrometry and molecular approaches, it is revealed that decreased nuclear localization of ATF2 results in reduced Protein kinase C delta type (PRKCD) expression, establishing a SIRT6/Myr-ATF2/PRKCD/VE-Cadherin pathway that enhances endothelial barrier integrity under high myristate conditions. These findings are validated in vitro (gene overexpression/knockdown cells) and in vivo (SIRT6 knockout/double-transgenic mice). The study provides both a novel method for identifying lysine-myristoylated proteins and critical insights into SIRT6 demyristoylation biology. Modulating the SIRT6 pathway might yield therapies to strengthen endothelial integrity and mitigate vascular dysfunction in CVDs, offering promising clinical translation avenues.",

Here, a critical role of LGR4 is demonstrated in islet β cell mass using a group of transgenic mice with LGR4 deficiency. Knock-out of Lgr4 in the pancreas and islet β cells significantly reduced islet β cell mass, and subsequently impaired glucose metabolism upon the challenge of a high-fat diet. Deficiency of LGR4 in these mice or in cultured INS-1 cells showed a significant reduction in islet β cell proliferation measured by Ki-67, EdU, and CCK-8 assay. Increase of islet β cell proliferation induced by Rspondin-LGR4 signaling occurred via Wnt-β-catenin-Ccnd1 axis. In addition, the deficiency of LGR4 in islet β cells significantly increased apoptosis. Inhibition of RANKL-RANK signaling by the TRAF-STOP inhibitor significantly attenuated apoptosis of cultured INS-1 cells induced by deficiency of LGR4. Overall, this work shows that deficiency of LGR4 reduces islet β cell mass via suppression of proliferation and concurrent increase of apoptosis. LGR4 in pancreatic islets is thus critical for the control of glucose homeostasis.",

    "combined_text": "Post-Translational Modifications of TOE3 Regulate Antiviral Defense in Tobacco.\n\nPost-translational modifications (PTMs) affect the function of transcription factors and regulate plant immune responses. APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor TARGET OF EAT3 (TOE3) plays a pivotal role in plant antiviral immunity. However, little is known about the impact of PTMs on TOE3 function. Here, that casein kinase II α subunit-like protein (CK2αL) is identified to interact with TOE3, phosphorylating it at serine 58 (S58) and threonine 128 (T128). Overexpression of CK2αL enhances the stability of TOE3 to upregulate the expression of defense-related genes, thereby improving tobacco resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Additionally, the F-box protein FBXL1 interacts with TOE3 and promotes the ubiquitination-degradation of TOE3 through the 26S proteasome, and overexpression of FBXL1 facilitates TMV infection in tobacco. Importantly, CK2αL-phosphorylated TOE3 exhibits a lower binding affinity to FBXL1 compared to the nonphosphorylated TOE3, thereby protecting TOE3 from FBXL1-mediated degradation by the 26S proteasome. The stable TOE3 activates the expression of defense-related genes to enhance the resistance of plants to viral infection. Taken together, the findings demonstrate a mechanism by which phosphorylation and ubiquitination cooperatively regulate the stability of TOE3 to fine-tune antiviral immunity in tobacco.",

Despite fish being a major source of aquatic protein for humans, no study has yet addressed how to reduce the risk of human exposure to MPs when consuming fish. This study investigated 1,075 fish from 37 species across representative fishing areas, and the presence of MPs in various tissues, such as the gills, guts, and muscles, was analyzed to assess fish food safety comprehensively. MPs (particles >20 μm in size) were detected in 36.28% of the gills and 39.63% of the guts but were not detected in muscle tissues. Compared with those from deeper waters, the fish from upper layers presented greater MP abundances and smaller average sizes. A significant negative correlation was detected between the abundance of MPs in fish and their length and weight. The global per capita MP consumption from captured fish, including all tissues and muscles, is approximately 5.60 × 10",

    "combined_text": "Alpha-Ketoisocaproate Attenuates Muscle Atrophy in Cancer Cachexia Models.\n\nCancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a multifactorial syndrome characterised by progressive loss of muscle mass with limited Food and Drug Administration treatments. Although emerging evidence suggests that l-leucine and β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate (HMB) have potential for treating CAC, the role of α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), a metabolite of l-leucine, remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the use of KIC as a therapeutic agent for CAC-induced muscle atrophy by targeting myostatin.\n\nWe evaluated the effect of KIC on muscle atrophy using BALB/c mice and C2C12 myotubes as models of C26- and 4T1-induced CAC. Male and female mice were injected with C26 and 4T1 cells, respectively. Grip strength was measured weekly, and mice were sacrificed 4 weeks post-injection for muscle collection. C2C12 myotubes were treated with conditioned media (CM) derived from C26 or 4T1 cells.\n\nKIC suppressed mRNA expression of myostatin, a key regulator of muscle atrophy, more effectively than did l-leucine (-26.37 ± 4.11%, p < 0.01). KIC enhanced protein turnover in C2C12 myotubes and maintained 50% cell viability at high concentrations (KIC: 4.68 mM, HMB: 3.11 mM). Following CM treatment, KIC suppressed MuRF1 and MAFbx expression in a myostatin-dependent manner, thereby reducing their polyubiquitination. KIC restored Akt-FoxO3a phosphorylation, leading to improved myotube diameter (+63.8 ± 25.71%, p < 0.05) and fusion index (+51.9 ± 22.6%, p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence and nuclear fractionation revealed that KIC reduced FoxO3a nuclear accumulation. CM reduced p-Akt-FoxO3a interaction, which was rescued by KIC. In vivo, KIC administration increased body weight (11.11 ± 8.53%), grip strength (24.76 ± 10.58%), and skeletal muscle mass (p < 0.001) in C26 tumour-bearing mice. Protein expression of myostatin in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (-23.57 ± 12.22%, p < 0.05) and serum (-52.11 ± 3.56%, p < 0.001) was lower in KIC-treated mice (n = 12) compared with that in the controls. KIC increased the mean fibre cross-sectional area in TA (24.51 ± 14.14%, p < 0.01). In 4T1 tumour-bearing mice, KIC improved body weight (13.10 ± 10.76%) and grip strength (7.42 ± 4.33%) (p < 0.001, n = 10). Serum myostatin levels (-57.43 ± 9.46%, p < 0.001) and skeletal muscle weight were reduced in KIC-treated mice (n = 10).\n\nOur findings demonstrate that KIC improves muscle function in CAC-induced muscle atrophy by regulating myostatin expression in skeletal muscle via the Akt-FoxO3a pathway.

    "combined_text": "RSV infection disrupts gut microbiota and metabolic homeostasis in mice, regulating pulmonary inflammation via the SPHK/S1P pathway.\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary pathogen for lower respiratory tract infections in children, posing a significant health threat. However, the systemic effects of RSV, particularly on gut microbiota and immune regulation along the gut-lung axis, are not well understood. We utilized a mouse model of RSV infection and assessed dynamic changes in the gut microbiome via high-throughput sequencing. We also investigated the interplay between pulmonary inflammation and gut microbiota, as well as their metabolites, through metabolomics analysis. RSV infection did not substantially alter the gut microbiota's alpha diversity but modified the relative abundance of specific phyla and genera. Notably, there was an increase in taxa such as Bacteroidetes and Veillonella, which may be linked to inflammation. Concurrently, sphingolipid components, including sphingomyelin, sphingosine, and ceramide, were significantly reduced in RSV-infected mice, correlating with increased pulmonary sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) protein expression. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated the potential of sphingolipids as biomarkers for distinguishing healthy from RSV-infected states. Inhibition of the S1P metabolic pathway, using sphingosine kinase (SPHK) and S1P inhibitors, reduced S1P expression and pulmonary inflammation, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Dietary changes, notably a low-fat diet, ameliorated lung inflammation and neutrophil accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, highlighting the role of dietary intervention in managing RSV infection. Immunophenotyping revealed the effects of SPHK and S1P inhibitors on lymphocyte subpopulations, foreshadowing their roles in modulating immune responses. These findings offer novel insights into how RSV infection modulates pulmonary inflammation by altering gut microbiota and metabolic pathways, providing a basis for new therapeutic strategies.\n\nOur research provides new insights into how respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection affects the host's gut microbiota, lipid metabolism, and the immune-inflammatory network. The findings demonstrate that dietary modulation and pharmacological intervention of the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway can mitigate inflammation caused by RSV infection, presenting potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat RSV infections.",

Long-term consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet not only leads to metabolic disruptions in the body but also disturbs brain homeostasis, particularly affecting the amygdala, a key region involved in regulating depression.\n\nThis study explored the therapeutic potential of geniposide, a bioactive iridoid glycoside known for its antiinflammatory properties, in mitigating HF diet-induced depressive behaviors and amygdala pathology.\n\nGeniposide supplementation significantly improved HF diet-induced depression, as assessed through various behavioral tests including the open field test, forced swimming test, elevated plus maze test, and tail suspension test. Geniposide demonstrated notable synaptic protective effects, evidenced by an increase in the length of the active zone and postsynaptic density thickness, as well as a decrease in the synaptic cleft in the amygdala of HF diet-fed mice. Additionally, geniposide suppressed microglial activation, downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-6], and reduced C3/C1q expression. Furthermore, geniposide administration markedly decreased the colocalization of C1q, a microglia-derived complement component, with postsynaptic density protein 95-positive puncta in the amygdala.\n\nIn summary, this study demonstrates that geniposide alleviates HF diet-induced depressive behaviors, which is associated with improved synaptic health and reduced neuroinflammation in the amygdala.

Derived from natural sources such as soil and vegetation decomposition, natural DOM (N-DOM) typically features humic-like substances with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups that stabilize heavy metals through complexation. However, microplastic-derived DOM (MP-DOM), increasingly prevalent due to plastic degradation, may interact differently with heavy metals, potentially exacerbating environmental risks amid rising plastic pollution. Yet, how heavy metals drive molecular transformations in MP-DOM versus N-DOM remains unclear, hindering accurate pollution assessments. Here, we compare interactions between N-DOM and MP-DOM with cadmium, chromium (Cr), copper, and lead from both fluorescence and molecular perspectives. Our results show that N-DOM, dominated by humic-like substances (46.0-57.3 %), lignin-like (55.0-64.9 %), and tannin-like (10.1-17.6 %) compounds, forms more stable heavy metal complexes via carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, and ether groups than MP-DOM. By contrast, MP-DOM-enriched in protein/phenolic-like substances (13.8-24.0 %), condensed aromatic (12.1-28.5 %), and protein/aliphatic-like (8.6-12.4 %) compounds-yields less stable complexes and is highly susceptible to Cr-induced oxidation. Mass-difference network analysis and density functional theory calculations further reveal that both DOM types undergo heavy-metal-triggered decarboxylation and dealkylation, but N-DOM retains complex structures, whereas MP-DOM degrades into smaller, hazardous molecules such as phenol and benzene. This study underscores the potential for heavy metals to exacerbate the ecological risks associated with the transformation of MP-DOM, providing crucial insights to inform global risk assessment and management strategies in contaminated waters where plastic and metal pollution co-occur.",

    "combined_text": "A Comprehensive Review on Recent Advances in Plant Flour-Based Edible Tableware.\n\nNowadays, plastic has become an integral part of our daily used products. Packaging is the sector where a significant portion of plastics are being used, and it has increased many folds after the recent pandemic. The plastic-based cutlery, cups, bowls, and plates have been commonly used in ready-to-eat packaged food, and they include mostly single-use plastic; thus, there is an urgent need for substitution with eco-friendly alternatives. The edible cups, bowls, and cutlery could be a promising alternative to the plastic counterparts. This review debated the current scenario in edible cutlery fabrication and characterization. The plant-based, eco-friendly edible flour materials are commonly used for fabricating edible cutlery such as bowls, cups, and spoons. The fortification and enrichment of additives into the edible cutlery and tableware were promising to improve the physical and functional performance. To develop edible cutlery, various flours such as millet, wheat, and rice have already been explored, and the results are promising for attaining sustainable development. The edible spoons prepared by using various flours such as finger millet and wheat flour with ashwagandha powder showed high proximate composition, including protein 5.96% and carbohydrates 85.73%. Similarly, the edible cutlery prepared using rice flour, wheat flour, and banana blossom powder resulted in a high water absorption capacity of 31.59% and showed high biodegradable capacity and decayed in 5 days. The use of this edible tableware not only reduces plastic waste issues but also makes our food healthier and nutrition-rich. Hence, this review aims to provide an overview of edible cutlery's needs and current status.",

In this review, we emphasize the essential importance of strength training in managing sarcopenia, highlighting the role of microRNAs, small nucleotides that were the subject of last year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. These microRNAs regulate protein synthesis and are present in all biological fluids. Some of them are expressed differently by subjects affected by sarcopenia (as happens in various forms of cancer or other diseases). Therefore, monitoring a specific signature of microRNAs can better clarify the etiopathology of sarcopenia, providing an early biomarker for sarcopenia (currently, there are some hypotheses, but none is well recognized), and even serve as the basis for the development of drugs.",

However, its influencing factors are still unclear, which limits its precise clinical application. This study aims to investigate the correlation between nutrition-related indicators and PNI and their impact on PNI, with the expectation of providing a more reliable basis for clinical nutritional assessment and intervention, filling the current gap in the research of influencing factors of PNI, and promoting the implementation of individualized nutritional therapy in the comprehensive management of esophageal cancer.\n\nThe clinical baseline data of 1,894 patients who underwent esophageal cancer surgery between January 2016 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to investigate the association between PNI and age, weight status, hepatic and renal function, glucose metabolism, inflammation, as well as other indicators.\n\nAmong the 1,894 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer, 1,599 (84.4%) were male and 295 (15.6%) were female. The age of onset was comparatively higher in females than in males. The univariate analysis of PNI revealed that the low PNI group had a higher average age compared to the high PNI group, and there was a significantly higher proportion of individuals aged ≥65 years in the low PNI group (55%) than in the high PNI group (46.6%) (P<0.05). The high PNI group exhibited significantly higher body weight and body mass index (BMI) compared to the low PNI group, along with a higher prevalence of overweight. Conversely, the low PNI group demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of wasting and neoadjuvant therapy (NT) treatment (P<0.05). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, by constructing the multivariate logistic regression equation, the results showed that: age [odds ratio (OR) =0.574, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.399-0.824, P=0.003] and NT (OR =0.186, 95% CI: 0.118-0.295, P<0.001) were identified as significant risk factors for high PNI group. Conversely, total protein (TP) (OR =17.194, 95% CI: 10.555-28.009, P<0.001), albumin/globulin ratio (A/G) (OR =5.128, 95% CI: 3.159-8.324, P<0.001), prealbumin (PA) (OR =3.195, 95% CI: 1.942-5.256, P<0.001), white blood cell (WBC) (OR =3.627, 95% CI: 1.729-7.608, P=0.001), platelet count (PLT) (OR =1.905, 95% CI: 1.047-3.465, P=0.035) and hemoglobin (Hb) (OR =2.499, 95% CI: 1.653-3.778, P=0.035) were protective factors in the high PNI group.\n\nPNI is an indicator that comprehensively reflects nutritional, immune and metabolic status. Patients with low PNI need to focus on the elderly, emaciated, and NT treatment groups, which also provides a basis for the timing of nutritional intervention. Meanwhile, increasing protein intake (improving TP and PA), correcting anemia (Hb), and maintaining PLT and WBC levels may help improve PNI and clinical prognosis.",

Independent predictors linked to recurrence and RFS were identified through comprehensive univariate and multivariate analyses, and the identified factors were subsequently integrated into nomogram models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and the concordance index (C-index) were employed to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomograms.\n\nOur investigation identified several key risk factors for recurrence, including age, tumor number, tumor differentiation, preoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI), preoperative systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and postoperative protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) level. For RFS, significant predictors included tumor number, tumor differentiation, preoperative SII, postoperative PIVKA-II, and postoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The nomograms exhibited strong predictive performance, achieving a C-index of 0.837 (95% CI: 0.775-0.896) for recurrence prediction and 0.837 (95% CI: 0.788-0.886) for RFS. Our nomogram for recurrence prediction outperformed traditional staging systems like China Liver Cancer (CNLC) staging and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC). Calibration curves and discriminative ability assessments confirmed the nomograms' reliability in predicting actual outcomes and stratifying patients into distinct prognostic subgroups with significant RFS differences across risk categories.\n\nThe nomogram models established in this research provide an exceptionally accurate and individualized method for predicting recurrence and RFS in initially uHCC patients undergoing LPI-based conversion hepatectomy, potentially aiding clinicians in devising tailored treatment plans and enhancing patient outcomes.",

The total viable count (TVC) and E-coli count revealed non-significant differences. There was no negative impact on histological changes in intestine due to inclusion of rice DDGS. There was no negative impact on histological changes such as crypt depth, villus width and villus height in intestine due to interaction between DDGS and enzyme. The carcass traits revealed non-significant differences for dressing percentage, overall giblet weight and abdominal fat.\n\n- It was concluded that rice DDGS can be incorporated upto 20 levels in broiler diet without any adverse effect, however inclusion of 15 percent rice DDGS supplemented with protease enzyme proved to be more economical in broilers.",

With increasing interest in natural products, Centella asiatica has garnered attention for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of C. asiatica extracts (CE) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T).\n\n: CEs were prepared by extracting C. asiatica leaf powder using ethanol at concentrations of 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%. In LPS-stimulated MAC-T cells, the study investigated the ability of CE to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and its impact on casein protein synthesis.\n\n: C. asiatica extract with 60% ethanol (CE60) exhibited the highest radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content among the tested extracts. In MAC-T cells, CE60 significantly attenuated LPS-induced inflammation by down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, as well as inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B activation. CE60 also reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species through upregulating nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 and associated antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 1, GPx4, superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1, SOD2, and catalase. Moreover, CE60 restored the synthesis of casein proteins (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, and CSN2) in LPS-treated MAC-T cells, indicating a protective effect on lactation function under inflammatory conditions.\n\n: Taken together, CE60 has potential as a natural substance for the prevention of bovine mastitis by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in mammary epithelial cells.",

However, only zilpaterol affected dressing percentage, longissimus thoracis muscle, and body fat reduction. The combined supplementation increased final live weight without altering feed intake, thereby enhancing energy availability to promote carcass weight and dressing carcass compared to lambs treated with zilpaterol alone.\n\n: Zilpaterol hydrochloride (0.20mg/kg of live weight/d, equivalent to 7.55 mg/lamb/d) and virginiamycin (22 mg/lamb/d) improved growth and energy retention, but only zilpaterol improved dressing percentage and reduced fat traits of carcass and non-carcass components.

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of supplementing urea-biuret (UB) and urea-biuret-nitrate (UBN) mixtures relative to urea (U) on rumen fermentation and microbial N outflow in growing steers. Twelve American Aberdeen steers were used in a replicated and balanced 3 × 3 Latin square design (LSD) with three periods of 35 days each. Steers were housed in pens and consumed a corn silage-based diet. Steers were stratified by body weight and randomly allocated to one of the three NPN supplementation treatments. Treatments were supplementation with U, UB, and UBN, adjusted to the amount of N provided by U when included at 1% of the diet on a dry matter (DM) basis. Intake and feeding behavior were individually recorded throughout the experiment. In each period, steers were adapted to increasing levels of NPN during the first 8 days. From day 19 to 23, feed and fecal samples were collected to assess nutrient digestibility. Samples of blood, rumen contents, and omasal digesta were collected on d 20 to 23. On d 24, rumen evacuation was performed and subsequently steers were dosed with Co-EDTA and YbCl3 to determine the passage rate of digesta flow. Rumen fluid collection was conducted on d 24 and 25. Steers did not receive NPN supplementation from day 26 to 35 during the washout period. Microbial N flow was estimated for each animal within periods. Intake, digestibility, digesta flow, and microbial N flow were analyzed using a 3 × 3 LSD, while blood and rumen fermentation parameters were analyzed using a 3 × 3 LSD with repeated measures. Steers supplemented with UB tended (P < 0.07) to consume more DM and organic matter (OM) than those supplemented with UBN; however, animals supplemented with UBN tended (P = 0.051) to digest more acid detergent fiber in the total tract. Steers supplemented with U and UB showed greater (P < 0.05) DM and OM flow throughout the omasum than those with UBN. Microbial N flow, microbial efficiency, and the concentration of total volatile fatty acids were not different (P > 0.10) among NPN-supplemented treatments. Steers supplemented with UBN showed lesser (P < 0.05) concentration of ammonia than those with U and UB. In conclusion, novel NPN mixtures have the potential to modify ruminal fermentation without affecting microbial protein outflow.",

The objective of this experiment was to examine the effect of varying dietary trypsin inhibitor units (TIU) on the performance, nitrogen digestibility and retention in nursery pigs. Sixty barrows (5.6 ± 0.65 kg body weight [BW]), weaned at 19-21 d of age, were randomly allocated across six dietary treatments (n=10/treatment). Diets balanced for metabolizable energy (ME), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine were fed in two phases over the 42-d study, lasting 14 and 28 d, respectively. Dietary treatments were formulated on a soybean TIU protein (TIU/mg) basis, using soybean meal, raw whole soybeans, soybean oil, and soyhulls to target 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 TIU/mg in complete feed for both dietary phases. For phase 1 and 2 diets, analyzed TIU/mg were 0.22/0.54, 0.47/0.61, 1.71/1.98, 2.88/3.44, 3.79/4.01, and 6.15/5.42, respectively, averaging 0.38, 0.54, 1.85, 3.16, 3.9, and 5.79 TIU/mg across both phases. Pigs were individually housed with ad libitum access to water and feed. Pig BW and feed disappearance were measured at the start and end of each phase to calculate pig performance parameters. On d 17, a subgroup of 48 pigs (n=8/treatment) were moved to metabolism crates for total fecal and urine collection to analyze nitrogen digestibility and retention. Data were analyzed using pig as the experimental unit to assess the effect of analyzed TIU levels, including linear and quadratic contrasts on all parameters. No quadratic responses were reported overall (P > 0.05). At the end of the experiment, pig BW decreased from 25.3 to 15.5 kg as the diet increased from 0.38 to 5.79 TIU/mg (linear, P < 0.0001). Moreover, as TIU increased, overall average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and feed efficiency were attenuated, resulting in reductions by 49, 32, and 26%, respectively (linear, P < 0.01). During phase 2, at the highest levels of dietary TIU/mg, nitrogen digestibility (%) was reduced by 5.3% (linear, P = 0.001), and nitrogen retention (% of intake) decreased by 15.3% (linear, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, there was a constant reduction in growth performance, feed efficiency, and nitrogen retention as soybean TIU increased in the diet of nursery pigs.",

This study investigated post-inflection-point growth patterns in two genetically distinct pig breeds-the lean-type Yorkshire pig (YP) and the fatty-type Qingyu pig (QYP)-with the aim of elucidating breed-specific characteristics that influence pork quality and yield. Comprehensive evaluations of carcass traits, meat quality attributes, nutritional composition, and gene expression profiles were conducted. After the growth inflection point, carcass traits exhibited greater variability than meat quality traits in both breeds, though with distinct patterns. YPs displayed superior muscle development, with the longissimus muscle area (LMA) increasing rapidly before plateauing at ~130 kg, whereas QYPs maintained more gradual but sustained muscle growth. In contrast, intramuscular fat (IMF)-a key determinant of meat flavor and texture-accumulated faster in YPs post inflection but plateaued earlier in QYPs. Correlation and clustering analyses revealed more synchronized regulation of meat quality traits in QYPs, while YPs showed greater trait variability. Gene expression patterns aligned with these phenotypic trends, highlighting distinct regulatory mechanisms for muscle and fat development in each breed. In addition, based on the growth curves, we calculated the peak age at which the growth rate declined in lean-type and fat-type pigs, which was approximately 200 days for YPs and around 270 days for QYPs. This suggests that these ages may represent the optimal slaughter times for the respective breeds, balancing both economic efficiency and meat quality. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing pork quality through precision management and offer theoretical guidance for developing breed-specific feeding strategies, slaughter timing, and value-added pork production tailored to consumer preferences in the modern food market.",

However, oat protein exhibits weak functional properties, particularly in emulsification. Casein-based ingredients are commonly employed to enhance emulsifying properties as a general practice in the food industry. pH-shifting processing is a straightforward method to partially unfold protein structures. This study modified a mixture of an oat protein isolate (OPI) and casein by combining a pH adjustment (adjusting the pH of two solutions to 12, mixing them at a 3:7 ratio, and maintaining the pH at 12 for 2 h) with an atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) treatment to improve the emulsifying properties. The results demonstrated that the ACP treatment significantly enhanced the solubility of the OPI/casein mixtures, with a maximum solubility of 82.63 ± 0.33%, while the ζ-potential values were approximately -40 mV, indicating that all the samples were fairly stable. The plasma-induced increase in surface hydrophobicity supported greater protein adsorption and redistribution at the oil/water interface. After 3 min of treatment, the interfacial pressure peaked at 8.32 mN/m. Emulsions stabilized with the modified OPI/casein mixtures also exhibited a significant droplet size reduction upon extending the ACP treatment to 3 min, decreasing from 5.364 ± 0.034 μm to 3.075 ± 0.016 μm. The resulting enhanced uniformity in droplet size distribution signified the formation of a robust interfacial film.

In our study, the effects of a pretreatment of skim milk (SM) by Tgase on milk protein fractionation by microfiltration were tested. Tgase was found to induce amount-dependent modifications of all milk proteins in SM and a reduction in deposit resistance for laboratory dead-end filtrations of up to 20%. This improvement in process performance could partially be confirmed in pilot-scale cross-flow filtrations of Tgase-pretreated SM and micellar casein solutions (MCC). These comparative trials with untreated retentates under a variation of ΔpTM (0.5-2 bar) at 10 and 50° revealed distinct differences in deposit behavior and achieved the reduction in deposit resistance in a range of 0-20%. The possibility of pre-fouling with enzymatically pretreated MCC prior to SM filtration was also investigated. Under different pre-fouling conditions, practical modes of retentate change, and pre-foulant compositions, a switch to untreated SM consistently resulted in an immediate and major increase in deposit resistance by 50-150%. This was partially related to the change in the ionic environment and the protein fraction. Nevertheless, our results underline the potential of Tgase pretreatment and pre-fouling approaches to alter filtration performance for different applications.",

This study investigates the impact of product information and sensory attributes on athletes' willingness to pay for an innovative high-protein bread. Utilizing a two-treatment experimental design, athletes were exposed to sensory evaluations either before or after receiving information. A combination of hedonic sensory analysis and economic evaluation assessed preferences through a non-hypothetical auction. Findings show that both sensory attributes-especially taste and aroma-and product information significantly influenced willingness to pay. The order of presentation played a crucial role: providing information first enhanced perceived value more strongly. While sensory evaluation moderately increased willingness to pay, product information had a stronger impact. A key contribution of this study is its novel evidence on how athletes balance sensory and informational cues in food evaluation-an aspect rarely explored. Contrary to assumptions that athletes ignore sensory quality due to their focus on nutrition, they did value sensory aspects, though they prioritized product information. These findings suggest that developing functional foods for athletes should integrate nutritional benefits and sensory appeal, as both elements contribute to acceptance and potential market success.",

The goal was to explore its potential to improve the nutritional value and sensory appeal of cookies relative to conventional and commercially available gluten-free alternatives. Nutritional analysis revealed that cookies with added sorghum flour showed increased levels of protein, ash, and polyphenolic compounds, while maintaining favorable macronutrient profiles. Notably, several bioactive compounds, such as gallic acid, caffeic acid, and apigenin, were detected exclusively in sorghum-containing samples, suggesting enhanced functional properties. Despite these compositional changes, textural measurements showed no significant differences in hardness or fracturability compared with the control. Sensory profiling using the Rate-All-That-Apply (RATA) method demonstrated that both samples (C20 and C40) achieved balanced results in terms of aroma as well as texture and were generally well accepted by the panel. The results indicate that moderate inclusion of sorghum flour (20% and 40%) can improve the sensory and nutritional profiles of gluten-free cookies without compromising product acceptability.

The germination and pepsin/pancreatin hydrolysis in amaranth releases antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds but the hydrolysis times (270 or 360 min) are too long to scale up in the development of amaranth functional ingredients. The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of the germination and pepsin/pancreatin hydrolysis reduction time on the techno-functional properties and nutraceutical potential of amaranth flours and hydrolysates. The germination process increased 12.5% soluble protein (SP), 23.7% total phenolics (TPC), 259% water solubility, and 26% oil absorption in germinated amaranth flours (GAFs) compared to ungerminated amaranth flours (UAFs). The ungerminated (UAFH) and germinated (GAFH) amaranth hydrolysates showed values of degree of hydrolysis up to 50% with 150 min of sequential (pepsin + pancreatin) hydrolysis. The enzymatic hydrolysis released 1.5-fold SP and 14-fold TPC in both amaranth flours. The water solubility was higher in both hydrolysates than in their unhydrolyzed flour counterparts. The reduction in hydrolysis time did not significantly affect the nutraceutical potential of GAFH, enhancing its potential for further investigations. Finally, combining germination and enzymatic hydrolysis in amaranth enhances nutraceutical and techno-functional properties, increasing the seed.

TFSE effectively reversed TNF-α-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, indicating anti-diabetic potential. TFSE also upregulated the phosphorylation of AKT (a key insulin signaling mediator) and the expression of adipogenic proteins (PPARγ, CEBPα) in TNF-α-exposed 3T3-L1, suggesting the mitigation of adipocyte dysfunction; however, the results did not reach statistical significance. The conventional extraction process was labor-intensive and time-consuming, and to enhance extraction efficiency and bioactivity, the process was subsequently optimized using environmentally friendly microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) in combination with the Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized extract (O-TFSE) was obtained over a significantly shorter extraction time and exhibited higher levels of total flavonoids and antioxidant activity in comparison to TFSE, while showing reduced levels of isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein) in relation to TFSE. Interestingly, O-TFSE retained similar efficacy in reversing TNF-α-induced insulin resistance and demonstrated significantly stronger α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities, indicating its enhanced potential for diabetes management.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the authentication of milk using advanced proteomic and chemometric approaches, with a focus on the discovery and application of protein and peptide biomarkers for species differentiation and fraud detection. Recent innovations in both top-down and bottom-up proteomics have markedly improved the sensitivity and specificity of detecting key molecular targets, including caseins and whey proteins. Peptide-based methods are especially valuable in processed dairy products due to their thermal stability and resilience to harsh treatment, although their species specificity may be limited when sequences are conserved across related species. Robust chemometric approaches are increasingly integrated with proteomic pipelines to handle high-dimensional datasets and enhance classification performance. Multivariate techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), are frequently employed to extract discriminatory features and model adulteration scenarios. Despite these advances, key challenges persist, including the lack of standardized protocols, variability in sample preparation, and the need for broader validation across breeds, geographies, and production systems. Future progress will depend on the convergence of high-resolution proteomics with multi-omics integration, structured data fusion, and machine learning frameworks, enabling scalable, specific, and robust solutions for milk authentication in increasingly complex food systems.",

In vitro digestion revealed that Plain tacos, especially those with plant-based fillings, had the highest resistant starch content and the lowest predicted glycemic index. Hierarchical clustering showed that resistant starch, moisture, and gelatinization onset temperature were closely linked in the Plain samples, whereas lipid-driven variables dominated in the Full-Fat tacos. In mice, tacos with a higher resistant starch content led to greater GLP-1 levels, lower ghrelin levels, and reduced insulin responses, suggesting improved satiety and glycemic control.

Its compatibility with other biopolymers, such as milk proteins, and its ability to form standalone cryogels allow it to be utilized for the fabrication of films with improved properties for applications in the food and biomedical-pharmaceutical industries. In the present work, the properties of kefiran films were investigated in the presence of milk proteins (sodium caseinate, native and heat-treated whey proteins, and their mixtures), alongside glycerol (as a plasticizer) and cryo-treatment of the film-forming solution prior to drying. A total of 24 kefiran films were fabricated and studied for their physical (thickness, moisture content, water solubility, color parameters and vapor adsorption), mechanical (tensile strength and elongation at break), and optical properties. Milk proteins increased film thickness, solubility and tensile strength and reduced water vapor adsorption. The hygroscopic effect of glycerol was mitigated in the presence of milk proteins and/or the application of cryo-treatment. Glycerol was the most effective at reducing the films' opacity. Heat treatment of whey proteins proved to be the most effective in increasing film tensile strength, reducing, at the same time, the elongation at break, while sodium caseinates in combination with cryo-treatment resulted in films with high tensile strength and the highest elongation at break. Cryo-treatment, carried out in the present study through freezing followed by gradual thawing of the film-forming solution, proved to be the most effective factor in decreasing film roughness. Based on our results, proper selection of the film-forming solution composition and its treatment prior to drying can result in kefiran-glycerol films with favorable properties for particular applications.",

This study presents a systems biology framework to simultaneously identify therapeutic targets for both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its associated cachexia (PDAC-CX), using cell-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs). The human metabolic network Recon3D was extended to include protein synthesis, degradation, and recycling pathways for key inflammatory and structural proteins. These enhancements enabled the reconstruction of cell-specific GSMMs for PDAC and PDAC-CX, and their respective healthy counterparts, based on transcriptomic datasets. Medium-independent metabolic biomarkers were identified through Parsimonious Metabolite Flow Variability Analysis and differential expression analysis across five nutritional conditions. A fuzzy multi-objective optimization framework was employed within the anticancer target discovery platform to evaluate cell viability and metabolic deviation as dual criteria for assessing therapeutic efficacy and potential side effects. While single-enzyme targets were found to be context-specific and medium-dependent, eight combinatorial targets demonstrated robust, medium-independent effects in both PDAC and PDAC-CX cells. These include the knockout of SLC29A2, SGMS1, CRLS1, and the RNF20-RNF40 complex, alongside upregulation of CERK and PIKFYVE. The proposed integrative strategy offers novel therapeutic avenues that address both tumor progression and cancer-associated cachexia, with improved specificity and reduced off-target effects, thereby contributing to translational oncology.",

However, the effects of germination on the nutritional profile of different pea varieties have not been extensively reported. Therefore, five varieties (Passion, Greenwood, Durwood, Agassiz, and Treasure) of peas were germinated for up to six days, and their nutrient profiles, protein digestibility, in vitro protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (IV-PDCAAS), and antioxidant activity (DPPH) were determined. In addition, B vitamins were determined for the first time in most of the varieties evaluated. Germination enhanced protein digestibility across all varieties, whereas IV-PDCAAS tended to decrease with increasing germination day. The impact of germination on starch content varied, with decreasing percentages found in some varieties and increased percentages found in others. Soluble fiber increased and insoluble fiber decreased with increasing germination days. Thiamine and niacin tended to increase with increasing germination day, while pyridoxine and folate decreased. The radical scavenging activity of the germinated peas increased with increasing germination days. Overall, germination tended to improve the nutritional composition of peas, with only a few exceptions. Furthermore, the interaction effects between variety and germination day support the importance of knowing both variety and length of germination when creating germinated pea products.",

This study investigates the mechanisms regulating extracellular adenosine levels in gastric cancer stem-like cells (GCSCs) derived from the MKN-74 cell line. Our results show that GCSCs release more ATP into the extracellular medium and exhibit higher levels of CD39 expression, which enables them to hydrolyze a greater amount of ATP. Furthermore, we also found that GCSCs possess a greater capacity to hydrolyze AMP, primarily due to the activity of the CD73 protein, with no significant changes in CD73 transcripts and protein levels between GCSCs and differentiated cells. Additionally, adenosine transport is primarily mediated by members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family in GCSCs, where a significant increase in the expression level of the ENT2 protein is observed compared to non-GCSCs MKN-74 cells. These findings suggest that targeting the adenosine metabolism pathway in GCSCs could be a potential therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.",

Among them, sarcopenia is a metabolic disorder characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. The two age-related diseases, DM and sarcopenia, share underlying pathophysiological pathways. This narrative literature review aims to provide an overview of the existing evidence on metabolomic studies evaluating DM associated with sarcopenia. Advancements in targeted and untargeted metabolomics techniques could provide better insight into the pathogenesis of sarcopenia in DM and describe their entangled and fluctuating interrelationship. Recent evidence showed that sarcopenia in DM induced significant changes in protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and in energy metabolisms in humans, animal models of DM, and cell cultures. Newer metabolites were reported, known metabolites were also found significantly modified, while few amino acids and lipids displayed a dual behavior. In addition, several therapeutic approaches proved to be promising interventions for slowing the progression of sarcopenia in DM, including physical activity, newer antihyperglycemic classes, D-pinitol, and genetic USP21 ablation, although none of them were yet validated for clinical use. Conversely, ceramides had a negative impact. Further research is needed to confirm the utility of these findings and to provide potential metabolomic biomarkers that might be relevant for the pathogenesis and treatment of sarcopenia in DM.",

Three influential online open databases (UniProt, AlzGene, and Allen Human Brain Atlas) were explored to identify the genes and encoded proteins involved in AD linked to mitochondrial and iron dysmetabolism. The databases were searched using specific keywords to collect information about protein composition, and function, and meta-analysis data about their correlation with AD. The extracted datasets were matched to yield a list of relevant proteins in AD. The biochemical analysis of their amino acid content suggested a defective synthesis of these proteins in poorly oxygenated brain tissue, supporting their relevance in AD progression.

This study compares green extraction methods (ultrasound-assisted extraction, UAE; and microwave-assisted extraction, MAE) for recovering polyphenols from buckwheat husk. MAE improved polyphenol yield by 43.6% compared to conventional acidified methanol extraction. Structural and chemical analyses of the residual husk material using SEM, FTIR, and fiber analysis revealed that MAE alters husk properties, enhancing polyphenol accessibility. Thus, MAE appears an efficient and sustainable alternative to acid- and solvent-based extraction techniques.

The review findings reaffirm that single-source plant proteins generally offer limited benefits compared to animal proteins such as whey, particularly in acute recovery settings, a limitation well-documented consistently in the literature. However, our synthesis highlights that well-formulated plant protein blends (e.g., combinations of pea, rice, and canola) can stimulate MPS at levels comparable to whey when consumed at adequate doses (≥30 g with ~2.5 g leucine).

However, traditional measures such as body weight, BMI, and waist circumference do not detect key changes in body composition, such as fat redistribution or muscle loss. The objective of this exploratory study was to assess the evolution of body composition and muscle strength after one year of treatment, and their relationship with metabolic biomarkers.\n\nProspective observational study in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and ultrasound (US); muscle strength was measured by handgrip dynamometry. Biomarkers analyzed included glucose, insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (and its fractions), triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), 6-interleukin (IL-6), vitamin D, myostatin, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21).\n\nSixty-one women (mean age 58 years) were included. After one year, fat mass and related parameters significantly increased, while skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength decreased. Sarcopenic obesity prevalence rose from 1.16% to 4.9%. No significant changes were found in biomarkers, but positive correlations were observed between fat parameters and insulin, HOMA-IR, and triglycerides, and negative correlations with HDL-cholesterol.\n\nBIA and US can detect unfavorable changes in body composition that are not reflected in conventional measurements. At one year post-diagnosis, women showed increased fat accumulation, muscle loss, and reduced strength, even without significant metabolic biomarker changes. Further research is warranted to elucidate the long-term clinical implications of these findings and the external validity in larger cohorts.",

    "combined_text": "Protein and Aging: Practicalities and Practice.\n\nDietary protein is an essential macronutrient derived from both plant and animal sources required for muscle building, immune function, and wound healing. However, in the United States, protein consumption worsens as individuals age, with 30% of men and 50% of women over 71 consuming inadequate dietary protein due to a variety of factors, including changes in gut function, loss of appetite, tooth loss, financial concerns, and social isolation. The aim of this review is to underscore the need for increased protein requirements in aging populations, highlight potential barriers, synthesize these protein requirements, and also recommend strategies to meet these increased protein needs. Achieving adequate protein status, especially when facing chronic or acute health concerns, is essential to promote muscle and bone strength (because aging is associated with significant decreases in postprandial muscle protein synthesis), to support immune health (due to immunosenescence), and to maintain a good quality of life. For older adults, the literature suggests that a dietary protein intake of at least 1.0-1.2 g/kg/day is required in healthy, aging populations, and intakes of 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day are necessary for those with chronic or acute conditions. These protein intake recommendations can increase to 2.0 g/kg/day in more severe cases of illness, malnutrition, and chronic conditions. The reviewed literature also suggests that evenly balanced protein distributions of 25-30 g of dietary protein (0.4 g/kg) per meal from animal and plant protein sources alike are sufficient to maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in older populations. Additionally, pre-sleep protein feeds of 40 g/night may be another strategy to improve daily MPS and amino acid utilization.",

However, its bioavailability and impact on lipid digestion and absorption remain poorly characterized. This study aimed to investigate silicon bioavailability after short-term DE supplementation and its effects on postprandial glycemia and triglyceridemia, the expression of lipid metabolism-related proteins, and the modulation of the intestinal mucosal barrier.\n\nFemale Wistar rats received daily oral supplementation of DE (equivalent to 2 or 4 mg silicon/kg body weight) for one week. Silicon digestibility, excretion, and hepatic accumulation were quantified. Postprandial glycemia and triglyceridemia were monitored. Lipid profile was analyzed by HPSEC in gastric and intestinal contents. Jejunal morphology and mucin-secreting cells were assessed histologically. Lipid metabolism markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in both intestinal and hepatic tissues.\n\nDE supplementation enhanced silicon absorption and increased hepatic levels. Fecal output and moisture content were also elevated, especially at the higher dose. DE significantly reduced postprandial triglyceridemia and consequently increased luminal triglyceride retention. These changes were associated with decreased jejunal levels of IFABP, ACAT2, and MTP, as well as reduced hepatic levels of MTP and LDLr, alongside increased levels of ABCG5/G8 and LXRα/β, indicating a partial blockage of lipid absorption and enhanced cholesterol efflux. The effects on the intestinal barrier were evidenced by villi shortening and an increase in mucin-producing cells.\n\nFood-grade DE is a bioavailable source of silicon with hypolipidemic potential, mainly by reducing intestinal lipid absorption. This is supported by lower postprandial triglycerides, increased luminal lipid retention, and decreased expression of lipid transport proteins. The study in healthy female rats underscores the importance of sex-specific responses and supports DE as a dietary strategy to improve lipid metabolism.",

These innovative sources aim to compete with conventional animal products by providing protein-rich, sustainable, nutritious, and flavorful options. Currently, five main categories of alternative proteins are being developed: plant-based proteins, cultured meat, single-cell proteins, edible insects, and seaweed. Nonetheless, several chemical and microbiological food safety hazards are associated with these alternatives Incorporating novel protein sources into food products may heighten the prevalence of existing food allergies. This could arise from extracting proteins from their natural matrices and utilizing them at significantly higher concentrations. Additionally, the introduction of new proteins may lead to the development of novel food allergies. Proteins that are currently seldom or never consumed may cause primary sensitisation or trigger cross-reactivity with known allergens. To date, alternative proteins have not been thoroughly studied for their allergenic potential, and there is no standardised method for assessing this risk. This review aims to explore non-traditional protein sources, discussing their nutritional and functional properties, as well as their potential allergenicity based on available research. We conducted a literature search in PubMed and Embase databases. We used specific keywords and MESH terms. A total of 157 studies were included in the review. The studies reviewed in our analysis reveal significant limitations, such as inconsistent methodologies, limited participant numbers, and a lack of long-term data, which hinder the ability to make clear conclusions regarding the safety of these new proteins for individuals with allergies. To address current challenge, future research should integrate food science, regulatory perspectives and advanced technologies.",

Traditional nutritional interventions in this population have either focused on supplementing individual nutrients-often with limited efficacy-or required comprehensive dietary overhauls that compromise patient adherence. In this narrative review, we explore the rationale for dietary nut enrichment as a feasible, multi-nutrient strategy tailored to the needs of kidney transplant recipients. Nuts, including peanuts and tree nuts with no added salt, sugar, or oil, are rich in beneficial fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds. We summarize the multiple post-transplant challenges-including obesity, sarcopenia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, immunological dysfunction, and chronic inflammation-and discuss how nut consumption may mitigate these issues through mechanisms involving improved micro-nutrient intake (e.g., magnesium, potassium, selenium), lipid profile modulation, endothelial function, immune support, and gut microbiota health. Additionally, we highlight the scarcity of randomized controlled trials in high-risk populations such as kidney transplant recipients and make the case for studying this group as a model for investigating the clinical efficacy of nuts as a nutritional intervention. We also consider practical aspects for future clinical trials, including the choice of study population, intervention design, duration, nut type, dosage, and primary outcome measures such as systemic inflammation. Finally, potential risks such as nut allergies and oxalate or mycotoxin exposure are addressed. Altogether, this review proposes dietary nut enrichment as a promising, simple, and sustainable multi-nutrient approach to support cardiometabolic and immune health in kidney transplant recipients, warranting formal investigation in clinical trials.",

Both oral and gut microbiota undergo changes with aging, characterized by a decline in microbial diversity and a shift toward potentially harmful species. The aim of this review is, therefore, to provide an overview of oral-gut communications in mediating frailty and sarcopenia. PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles. We limited our search to manuscripts published in the English language. Interactions between oral and gut microbiota occur mainly through three pathways namely the enteral, the bloodstream and the fecal-oral routes. Alterations in the oral-gut microbiota axis contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation (i.e., \"inflamm-ageing\") and mitochondrial dysfunction, key mechanisms underlying frailty and sarcopenia. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids and modified bile acids, appear to play an emerging role in influencing microbial homeostasis and muscle metabolism. Furthermore, poor oral health associated with microbial dysbiosis may contribute to altered eating patterns that negatively impact gut microbiota eubiosis, further exacerbating muscle decline and the degree of frailty. Strategies aimed at modulating the microbiota, such as healthy dietary patterns with reduced consumption of ultra-processed foods, refined carbohydrates and alcohol, ensuring an adequate protein intake combined with physical exercise, as well as supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, are increasingly recognized as promising interventions to improve both oral and gut microbiota health, with beneficial effects on frailty and sarcopenia.

    "combined_text": "Co-Targeting Bcl-xL with Mcl-1 Induces Lethal Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Diffuse Mesothelioma.\n\nDiffuse mesothelioma (DM) is a rare but highly aggressive and treatment resistant neoplasm with low survival rates. Effective therapeutic strategies are limited, and resistance to treatment is a major obstacle. Myeloid Cell Leukemia (MCL)-1 and B-cell leukemia (BCL)-xL are anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that block cell-intrinsic apoptosis through interactions on the mitochondrial outer membrane which contribute to therapeutic resistance. We investigated whether B-cell homology domain (BH)-3 profiles were consistent between intra-patient fresh tumor sample, patient-derived cells (PDC), and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) by BH3 profiling; we observed striking consistency which enabled cross model comparisons. Next, we co-targeted BCL-xl and MCL-1 and noted that the combination synergistically reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, BCL-xL inhibition affected the cells through both the canonical and the emerging non-canonical apoptotic pathways. BCL-xL induced mitochondrial depolarization which resulted in MCL-1 cellular dependency rendering cells highly sensitive to MCL-1 inhibition. Next, we co-targeted BCL-xL and MCL-1 in vivo which induced synthetic lethality in PDX models within hours, implying that this approach is not a safe strategy for clinical development. However, targeting MCL-1, which exerts its anti-apoptotic activity without non-apoptotic on-target effects, decreased the mitochondrial threshold for apoptosis and enhanced chemosensitivity without toxicity in PDX models. Our findings suggest that targeting the mitochondria via MCL-1 enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy but co-targeting two proteins in the Bcl-2 pathways results in synergistic lethality. These results will help define a safe clinical strategy to utilize Bcl-2 targeted therapy to undermine therapeutic resistance in patients with DM.",

It is well-established that interventions encompassing resistance training alone or in combination with whey protein supplementation, referred to hereafter as muscle-building interventions, are effective for increasing muscle mass and function in the elderly population. However, the impact of these muscle-building interventions on glucose metabolism in elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity remains unclear. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of muscle-building interventions on blood glucose and insulin resistance in elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity.\n\nThe muscle-building interventions in this study included resistance training alone and resistance training combined with whey protein supplementation. In this randomized controlled trial, elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity were divided into three distinct groups: the control group, the resistance training group, and the resistance training combined with whey protein supplement group. The muscle-building interventions were conducted for 12 weeks.\n\nImplementing muscle-building interventions showed significant improvements in glycemic indices (HbA1c, OGTT 2-hour plasma glucose) and insulin resistance levels (HOMA-IR, Gutt index) for elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity. These muscle-building interventions enhanced muscle functional indices (handgrip strength, 5-time chair stand test). The combination of resistance training with whey protein supplementation did not significantly enhance the favorable effects on glucose metabolism compared to resistance exercise alone. Correlation analyses revealed that improvements in muscle strength were significantly associated with enhancements in glucose metabolism.\n\nIn elderly T2DM patients with sarcopenic obesity, muscle-building interventions (particularly resistance exercise) have been shown to significantly improve blood glucose control and insulin resistance.",

Yaghooti grape in addition to its good flavor, is highly regarded by consumers due to its high nutritional value. However, the compact clusters and small berries are notable features that negatively impact its marketability. Gibberellin is widely used to reduce cluster density. This research aimed to identify lncRNAs involved in cluster formation and examine how their expression is influenced by gibberellin treatment. The expression of lncRNAs is spatiotemporally specific, and external stimuli can influence their expression. However, the role of lncRNA in modulating the transcriptional pathway of gibberellin is unknown. The length of grape clusters increased from 107 to 184 mm under gibberellin treatment, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in cluster density. RNA-seq data related to Sistan Yaghooti grape clusters were examined at three stages of formation and in response to gibberellin to identify lncRNA transcripts. A total of 2021 lncRNAs were identified, of which 262 lncRNAs showed differential expression. The numbers of lncRNAs and target genes that exhibited significant differential expression were 76, 100, and 86 lncRNAs and 146, 143, and 138 target genes, respectively, in stage2 vs. stage1, stage3 vs. stage2, and stage3 vs. stage1. The target genes of lncRNAs were significantly associated with (Catabolic Process, hydrolase activity, Phosphorylation, ATP binding, response to abiotic stimulus). Furthermore, pathway analysis indicated that majority of genes in the treated samples were primarily linked to metabolic pathways and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in comparison to the control group. Specifically, genes such as cytokinin (CK), Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), squamosa-promoter binding protein-like2 (SPL2), LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD), Domain of Unknown Function 1218 (DUF1218), the non-specific phospholipase C2 (NPC2), Cytochrome P450 (P450 CYP), pectin methylesterases (PMEs), and AGAMOUS (AG) showed significantly increased expression in response to gibberellin. Some of these genes are targets of lncRNAs that interact with microRNAs (miRNAs) vvi-miR156, vvi-miR159, vvi-miR172, and vvi-miR319. Among the differentially expressed non-coding RNAs, lncRNA LOC100257036 and vvi-miR156 may contribute to gibberellin-mediated regulation of AG, potentially influencing cluster architecture through a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathway.",

Key processes include gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism and urea formation, bile acid synthesis, detoxification, endocrine functions, and immune functions. Various tests have been used to assess liver function. Fatty liver develops when fatty acid uptake exceeds the liver's capacity to oxidize fatty acids and export triacylglycerols and may negatively affect hepatic function. Metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics are opening new insights into hepatic adaptations in normal and abnormal situations, such as the roles of acylcarnitines, lysophospholipids, and sphingolipids. Nutritional strategies such as controlled energy dry cow diets and supplemental rumen-protected methionine and choline help maintain liver function during the periparturient period.

It is believed that the RAS plays a central role in stress-induced hepatic programming. To determine the effects of prenatal stress, sex, and age on hepatic RAS of the offspring, pregnant Wistar rats were divided into control and stress groups. The unpredictable stress protocol was performed in the last week of pregnancy. The offspring were divided according to sex, age, and intervention. At 90 and 120 days, the offspring´s blood and liver were collected to measure hepatic enzyme activity, isoprostane levels, and protein expression of the RAS and redox balance. At 90 days old, stress similarly reduced NOX4 in both sexes, while NOX2, NOX2/NOX4 ratio, and isoprostane were increased only in female offspring. Stress responses of NOX2 were still higher in females when compared to males. At 120 days, prenatal stress increased the activity of AST and ALT in females, while decreasing AST in males. Furthermore, stress enhances the expression of AT1R, ACE, and MasR in males, while reducing NOX2/NOX4 ratio. Still, stress reduced ACE2 expression and continued to increase NOX2/NOX4 ratio in females at 120 days. Prenatal stress induces hepatic programming in offspring in a sex- and age-specific way, altering the RAS and NOX4 pathways at 120-day-old males while inducing early redox changes in females at 90 days and remaining at 120 days.",

Baicalein has demonstrated potential benefits in the prevention and treatment of liver diseases. However, the mechanisms by which baicalein ameliorates hepatic ferroptosis in MASH remain inadequately understood. In this study, we established a mouse model of MASH induced by Western diet (WD) feeding. Our findings indicate that baicalein treatment ameliorated metabolic abnormalities and inhibited the progression of MASH in mice. Most importantly, baicalein supplementation significantly restored iron homeostasis in the liver, mitigating disorders such as iron overload and ferritin transport Additionally, baicalein reduced WD-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation. The protective effects of exogenous baicalein on ferroptosis were also observed in free fatty acid (FFA)-treated Raw264.7 cells. Mechanistically, macrophage, rather than hepatocyte, were implicated in the effect of baicalein. Furthermore, baicalein treatment inhibited WD or FFA-induced M1 polarization while activating the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/ ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (Nrf2/FSP1) signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that exogenous baicalein inhibits hepatic ferroptosis in MASH by promoting M2 polarization of macrophage through the Nrf2/FSP1 pathway, establishing that baicalein as a promising candidate drug for the treatment of hepatic ferroptosis in MASH.",

ABA signaling leads to a phospho-regulatory cascade involving the PP2C phosphatase ABI1 (PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C ABA INSENSITIVE 1) and kinase CIPK23 (CBL INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 23). ABI1 is inactivated by ABA, releasing the kinase CIPK23 to phosphorylate and inactivate AMT1 (AMMONIUM TRANSPORTER 1) transporters. To date, it was unclear whether this effective mechanism to prevent ammonium toxicity relies on various ABA sensors and general signaling or whether a specific ABA sensor is involved in this regulation. Here, we show that ammonium stress specifically induces the expression of a subset of PYL (PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1 - LIKE) ABA receptors, including PYL8. PYL8 is known to preferably bind and regulate the PP2C phosphatase AIP1 (AKT1 INTERACTING PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1). Addressing the upregulated PYLs, only a pyl8 mutant showed an increased sensitivity to high ammonium concentrations and a growth retardation in the response to high external ammonium conditions. Correspondingly, aip1 mutants showed a lower sensitivity and a delay in AMT1 reactivation. While AMT1 inactivation appears to be a general mechanism regulated by ABI1 and several PYLs, the function of AIP1 and PYL8 seems to be the regulation of AMT1 reactivation.",

However, their structural complexities and functional constraints during processing may limit their usefulness. In recent years, ultrasound technology has received significant interest as an effective method for modifying fish protein's structure through the cavitation effect to improve their functionality. This review highlights current advances in ultrasound-assisted fish protein extraction, with an emphasis on structural modification and functional characteristics augmentation. The paper thoroughly assesses existing scientific knowledge and discusses potential research directions. Overall, ultrasound technology has the potential to be a successful assistant technique for improving fish protein extraction efficiency, along with benefits such as faster processing and lower resource use. Ultrasound can significantly improve the functionality and technological applicability of fish proteins by reducing aggregation, modifying secondary and tertiary structures in aqueous systems, and enhancing molecular flexibility and interfacial activity. However, it should be highlighted that achieving these great synergistic effects necessitates optimizing processing settings based on the specific ultrasound equipment employed, the fish species under study, and the type of protein. Future studies should focus on using ultrasound to carefully tune the structure of fish proteins for engineering and tailoring their functionality to boost their compatibility for complicated food processing techniques such as high moisture extrusion, 3D printing and for the development of hybrid foods in combination with emerging protein sources.",

    "combined_text": "Effect of grape pomace supplementation in mid-lactation dairy ewes on production and quality of milk and methane emissions.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of including grape pomace (GP) in the diets of ewes during mid-lactation on milk composition, milk coagulation properties (MCP), and methane emissions, using a Laser Methane Detector (LMD). Twenty-four Sarda dairy sheep, homogeneous in body weight (BW; 59.1 ± 0.75 kg), milk yield (MY; 2.4 ± 0.007 kg/day), and days in milk (DIM; 101 ± 1 days), were allocated into three treatment groups. The control group (CTR) received no GP supplementation, the GP100 group was supplemented with 100 g/day per head of GP, and the GP150 group with 150 g/day per head of GP. The trial lasted six weeks, including one week for adaptation and five for sampling. Feed intake was recorded daily using an individual automatic feeding system (Biocontrol AS, Rakkestad, Norway), and individual milk samples were collected weekly. Methane emissions were measured during the final week of the trial over three consecutive days during both morning and evening milkings, with two-minute measurements per ewe. The inclusion of GP, at both dosages, did not affect milk yield, fat content, or protein content. However, GP reduced the concentration of saturated fatty acids (SFA) while increasing monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and total unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the milk. Notably, GP150 significantly increased the levels of CLA cis-9, trans-11 and C18:1 trans-11 compared to the CTR and GP100 groups. ME, expressed as respiration and eructation peaks, were not affected by GP supplementation. The means of concentration of methane during eructation events were 188.7, 160.64 and 185.45 ppm for CTR, GP100 and GP150, respectively. These results suggest that including 100 to 150 g of GP per day in the diet of lactating ewes can improve the fatty acid profile of milk without negatively impacting production traits, offering potential benefits for milk quality.",

Here, we designed a CRISPR library targeting 661 mitochondrial proteins and identified the MPC (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier) as a critical regulator of hPSC self-renewal and pluripotency. Notably, MPC inhibition reduced hPSC self-renewal and endoderm differentiation while promoting mesoderm differentiation, with no effect on ectoderm differentiation, all mediated by influencing glycolytic acetyl-CoA production. Specifically, the decrease in acetyl-CoA following MPC inhibition affected histone acetylation in hPSCs, compromising self-renewal. In contrast, MPC inhibition did not impact histone acetylation in differentiated cells; instead, it reduced the acetylation of non-histone proteins-EP300 and SMAD2-thereby enhancing mesoderm differentiation and repressing endoderm differentiation, respectively. These findings suggest that distinct effector proteins respond to variations in acetyl-CoA levels at different developmental stages, leading to a context-dependent regulation of cell fate determination by glycolytic acetyl-CoA in hPSCs.",

Attaining nutrition targets in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is challenging, with suboptimal nutrition associated with poor outcomes. Modification of oral and enteral feeds, via supplementation or substitution with concentrated formula, to increase energy and protein provision is a common strategy utilized to address these gaps. However, there is limited literature and no expert consensus to guide this practice. We conducted a scoping review following JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) methodology of all English-language studies (excluding reviews) exploring feed modification in the PICU in children aged up to 5 years published between 2010 and January 4, 2025. Of 2696 studies screened, 14 were included, with 57% (n = 8) published since 2020. Ten (71%) studies were randomized controlled trials and 8 (80%) of these explored congenital heart disease. Interventions comprised concentrated infant formula powder (n = 3; 30%), ready-to-feed liquid formula (n = 3; 30%), and expressed breast milk (n = 2; 20%). Primary outcomes varied with nutritional intake-related (n = 5; 50%) measures most frequently utilized. No consistent terminology was used to refer to \"feed modification\". Tolerance, ease of preparation, and contamination risk were identified as important considerations. In conclusion, a variety of techniques were used, with no consistent definitions, and the randomized trials were inconsistent in methodology and did not measure patient-centered outcomes. Further research is required to reach consensus for practice guidelines following further establishment of methods of feed modification that address nutrition gaps and improve patient outcomes.",

Rich with diverse bioactive elements, rice bran serves as a nontraditional functional food ingredient with health promoting attributes. The nutritional profile of rice bran compared to those of other cereal grains is inclusive of energy-providing carbohydrates, essential vitamins and minerals, and amino and fatty acids, as well as unique phytochemicals. The composition of rice bran consists of an array of phytosterols, prebiotics, tocotrienols, tocopherols, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds that contribute antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. A unique rice bran compound is γ-oryzanol, which is widely recognized for supporting the immune system, regulating blood lipids, and protecting against some types of cancer. In this review we have summarized the multifaceted potential of rice bran for reducing diarrhea and controlling diabetes and cardiometabolic disease, as well as preventing or controlling progression of cancer. Rice bran-mediated regulation of bowel function through prebiotics and soluble and insoluble fiber acts synergistically in lowering gut inflammation through microbiota and regulating the metabolism of lipids and proteins that are important for health. The capacity of rice bran to enhance nutritional status in connection with the prevention and management of chronic diseases merits greater attention in the food product marketplace. In this comprehensive overview of rice bran as a functional food for human health, we have also included its medical food potential for holistic well-being, health promotion, and disease prevention.",

Here, the inorganic Se bioconcentration was employed to generate Se-enriched Akkermansia muciniphila (Se-AM), and we investigated its Se distribution, selenoprotein and selenoamino acid species, essential elements, and amino acid contents. Furthermore, the major probiotic properties of Se-AM were evaluated. The results showed that the Se-AM exhibited remarkable survival and Se enrichment levels. The organic Se content in Se-AM accounted for approximately 81.9%, predominantly composed of protein bound Se (44.3%), followed by nucleic acid bound Se (17.8%) and polysaccharide bound Se (17.4%). The Se element in Se-AM exhibits a preference for binding to proteins with medium molecular weight, predominantly forming selenoamino acids containing SeCys2 and SeMet. Moreover, the content of both individual and total amino acids is higher in Se-AM compared to AM. Furthermore, Se-AM demonstrates robust acid resistance and antioxidant activity along with enhanced adhesion to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. It also possesses immune-stimulating properties by activating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in Raw 264.7 cells, leading to increased cytokine release. Transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated expression levels of key genes associated with potent antioxidants, strong cellular adhesion capabilities, and effective cancer cell eradication within Se-AM when compared to AM. Our findings indicated that the Se-AM holds promising potential as a novel probiotic formulation supplemented with Se for both its Se-enhancing properties and probiotic functionality.",

All patients were interviewed face-to-face before the surgery, at discharge, and on the 30th day post-discharge. FRAIL was used to determine frailty, and those ≥ 3 were considered 'frail'. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters were recorded during each interview. Additionally, nutritional status was determined by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), and 3-day food records were also collected.\n\nFrail patients (Median:18 days) experienced longer perioperative hospital stays compared to pre-frail (Median:14 days) (p < 0.001) and had a higher incidence of postoperative complications (p = 0.029). In addition to the MNA score (p < 0.001), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) (p < 0.001), calf circumference (CC) (p < 0.001), triceps skinfold thickness (p < 0.05), and handgrip strength (HGS) (p < 0.001) were found to be lower in frail patients at every interview.

Spirulina grows well in highly alkaline environments with a pH range of 9.5–11 such as pond, fresh and marine water. It is an excellent source of proteins, vitamins (ascorbic acid, tocopherol, and B-complex), minerals (iron and magnesium), and fatty acids (gamma linoleic acid, capric acid, palmitic acid, omega-3 and omega-6). It has a higher essential amino acid profiles than soybean meal, which usually is the main protein source in poultry diets. In addition, spirulina contains phytopigments (carotenoids and phycocyanins) and bioactive compounds (polyphenols and flavonoinds), which have a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, hypolipidemic, hypocholesterolemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. There has been variable results on growth-promoting effects of spirulina in broilers. Knowledge and detailed understanding of spirulina’s nutritional composition, (i.e., proximate, amino acid, vitamins, minerals, and fatty acid), mechanisms of action, and its supplementation value in broilers are critical to fully maximize its use in broiler nutrition. However, while most of these findings are valuable, they are scattered throughout the literature, making it difficult to use them in evidence-based decision-making in the poultry industry. The present review therefore attempts to pool current published evidence on spirulina’s chemical composition, and the effect of its supplementation on production indices and health status of broilers to enhance the adoption of these findings in decision support system in the poultry industry, as well as to identify knowledge gaps and fashion out new research directions. The phytochemical composition and mechanisms by which spirulina enhances broiler performance will also be reviewed.",

Six isocaloric and isolipidic diets were formulated, comprising a standard diet containing 10% corn starch and 40% fish meal, an HSD with 15% corn starch and 36% fish meal, and HSDs supplemented with 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% SUA. Compared to standard diet, HSD exhibited adverse effects including impaired feed utilization, growth retardation, diminished antioxidant capacity, and immune response, along with metabolic dysregulation and gut microbiota disturbances. Significant linear and quadratic dose-responses were detected for multiple parameters: feed conversion ratio, hepatosomatic index, viscerosomatic index, glycogen content, amylase and protease activities, and hepatic antioxidant status. The 0.5% SUA supplementation group demonstrated enhanced intestinal morphology, upregulated expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and Claudin-4) and antiapoptotic Bcl2, increased abundance of beneficial microbiota and suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (GRP78, PERK, IRE1, ATF6, eIF2α, and Chopα). Additionally, dietary 0.5% SUA upregulated hepatic anti-inflammatory mediators (Nrf2, TGFβ1, and IL10), glycolytic genes (PK, PFKL2, and GK), β-oxidation-related CPT1, antiapoptotic Bag, and glucose transporter GLUT2, while downregulating proinflammatory TNFα, gluconeogenic enzymes (PEPCK and G6Pase), lipogenic genes (ACC1 and FASN), and proapoptotic Bad. Broken-line regression analysis identified 0.46-0.50% as the optimal SUA inclusion level based on growth parameters. This study demonstrates that appropriate SUA supplementation alleviates HSD-induced oxidative stress, enhances intestinal barrier function, modulates gut microbiota, and maintains metabolic homeostasis, thereby improving starch utilization and growth performance.",

Sertoli cells orchestrate testicular immune responses during orchitis by modulating local inflammation and maintaining blood-testis barrier integrity. While Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), a critical adaptor molecule in the TLR4 signaling pathway, is known to mediate immune responses, its cell-specific role in Sertoli cells during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced orchitis remains elusive. Using an murine orchitis model established through intraperitoneal LPS administration, we observed pronounced testicular inflammation concurrent with dramatic upregulation of MyD88 protein levels (P < 0.05). To further investigate the Sertoli cell-specific function of MyD88, we generated conditional Myd88 knockout (cKO) mice. Compared to controls, cKO mice showed marked attenuation of testicular edema along with improved sperm motility and viability post-LPS challenge. Myd88 deletion also suppressed LPS-triggered surges in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), maintained seminiferous tubule architecture, and mitigated neutrophil infiltration. Further studies demonstrated that Myd88 deletion rescued LPS-induced BTB disruption by restoring the expression of key BTB components (Connexin43, Claudin-11). Additionally, NF-κB signaling pathway is activated by MyD88 mediated inflammatory responses. Collectively, these findings uncover Sertoli cell specific MyD88 as a key regulator in LPS-induced orchitis pathogenesis, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic target for orchitis.",

Black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) is gaining importance due to its high protein content with a well-balanced amino acid profile. A 90-day triplicate feeding trial was executed to evaluate the impact of partial and complete replacement of fish meal (FM) with BSFLM in the diet of Oreochromis niloticus.

    "combined_text": "PKD and scaffold NHERF1 mediate hypoxia-induced gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\n\nHypoxia has been implicated as a causal factor in mediating adipocyte dysfunction in obesity. Moreover, protein kinase D 1 (PKD1), a serine/threonine protein kinase, has been shown to contribute to diet-induced adiposity. Therefore, we investigated if PKD isoforms mediate hypoxia-induced dysfunction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Hypoxia increased phosphorylation of PKD1 at serine 916 (S916), the autophosphorylation site linked to PKD1 activation, indicating hypoxia-induced activation of PKD1 in adipocytes. Inhibition or depletion of PKD isoforms mitigated hypoxia-induced increase in hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), the master transcription factor mediating hypoxia-induced gene expression, confirming that PKDs modulate the hypoxia-induced mechanism in adipocytes. Surprisingly, depletion of PKD1 and PKD2, but not PKD3, attenuated hypoxia-induced HIF1α target gene expression. Unlike PKD3, PKD1 and PKD2 possess a unique PDZ-binding motif at their C-terminus. Indeed, hypoxia upregulated a PDZ-containing scaffold protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) and its interaction with PKD1, whereas NHERF1 depletion attenuated hypoxia-induced PKD1 phosphorylation, HIF1α protein accumulation, and gene expression. Mechanistically, hypoxia induced nuclear import of active PKD1, which phosphorylated histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) at S498 that promoted cytoplasmic localization of HDAC5. HDAC5 deacetylated heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) at lysine 77, which dissociated HSP70 from HIF1α, allowing HSP90 association that stabilized HIF1α. Interestingly, PKD inhibition reversed hypoxia effects on subcellular localization of PKD1/HDAC5, HSP70 acetylation, and HIF1α/HSP90 association. In summary, our findings reveal a NHERF1-PKD1-HDAC5 mechanism modulating hypoxia-induced gene expression in adipocytes.",

    "combined_text": "The bZIP3-AS1 complex promotes CONSTANS-induced FLOWERING LOCUS T activation in a daylength-dependent manner.\n\nPlants monitor daylength to synchronize their flowering time with their surroundings and thus maximize reproductive fitness. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), CONSTANS (CO) activates the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT); this activation is a crucial aspect of the daylength-dependent regulation of flowering time. Here, we demonstrate that the basic leucine zipper 3 (bZIP3) transcription factor is important for CO-induced FT expression under long photoperiod conditions in Arabidopsis. We isolated bZIP3 as a CO-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening and verified bZIP3-CO complex formation in Arabidopsis through co-immunoprecipitation assays. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of bZIP3 are very similar to those of CO, and bZIP3 protein levels fluctuate throughout the day, with high abundance in the late afternoon. The bzip3 mutant displayed delayed flowering under long photoperiods, whereas bZIP3 overexpression accelerated flowering regardless of daylength. bZIP3 directly binds to the FT promoter region containing CO-responsive elements in vivo. FT messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the bzip3 mutant and bZIP3 overexpression lines correlated with their flowering times and changed only during the daytime. bZIP3 overexpression resulted in significantly lower FT transcript levels in the co mutant background than in the wild type. Furthermore, bZIP3 forms a complex with ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1), a CO partner that helps CO induce FT expression. The bzip3 as1 double mutant flowered later than the two single mutants under longer daylengths, and FT mRNA levels were much lower in the double mutant than in the bzip3 single mutant. Collectively, our findings uncover a new layer of photoperiod-dependent FT regulation in which bZIP3 facilitates CO to activate FT transcription by forming a complex with AS1.",

Inflammation resulting from the dynamic imbalance of macrophage polarization and the injury of podocytes caused by lipid accumulation together drives the disease process. This study aims to explore the mechanism of TP alleviating aging with DKD via macrophage polarization and podocyte lipid accumulation. Initially, aging with DKD model rats were treated with or without TP (75, 150, 300 mg/kg once daily, ig) for 8 weeks; lipid accumulation in podocytes, inflammatory cytokines in serum and kidney, and macrophage phenotype in kidney were detected. We found silencing information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a key protein of cell senescence; its activation contributes to the transition of macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most important monomeric compound of TP, has been found to stably bind to SIRT1 by molecular docking experiment. Furthermore, an indirect co-culture system of RAW264.7 and MPC5 cells was constructed to investigate the effect of EGCG on the targeted macrophage polarization, ameliorating podocyte lipid accumulation. The agonist and inhibitor of SIRT1 were used to validate through immunofluorescence analysis, Oil Red O staining, lipid-related protein analysis, and phalloidin marking. We demonstrated that TP promotes SIRT1 activation, thereby enhancing the transformation of macrophages into the M2 phenotype, reducing renal inflammation, and ultimately alleviating podocyte lipid accumulation. Our study provides a new insight into the ways in which tea and its chemicals protect DKD in the elderly.",

The cortex and medulla were separated and dissociated into single-cell suspensions using mechanical and enzymatic methods. Three approaches were tested to establish a 3D model culture system: matrix-free ovarian spheroids (MFOS), a Matrigel-based three-layer gradient system (3LGS), and Biosilk scaffolds (Silk-Ovarioid). In parallel, paired controls from each patient and ovarian area were cultured in a standard 2D system for the same duration.\n\nThe 3D culture systems were monitored every second day to detect signs of aggregation and growth. Freshly fixed tissue, as well as 2D- and 3D-cultured samples were further processed for transcriptomic profiling after 42 days of culture using RNA sequencing.

This study investigated the association between nutrition risk and oral mucosal membrane pressure injuries.\n\nThis multicenter prospective cohort study enrolled 1533 intensive care unit patients with endotracheal tubes between April and December 2023. The primary model examined the association between nutrition risk and oral mucosal membrane pressure injuries. Additional analyses evaluated associations of medical nutrition therapy and inflammatory biomarkers (procalcitonin and C-reactive protein) with the outcome. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used, and five sequential models adjusted for confounders.\n\nOverall, 551 patients (36.3%) developed oral mucosal membrane pressure injuries. Nutrition risk was independently associated with an increased risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.75). Medical nutrition therapy, including enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition, and combined therapy, was associated with a reduced risk compared with suspended diet, with longer durations conferring greater benefit (HR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.74-0.80). Additionally, elevated procalcitonin levels were associated with an increased risk of oral mucosal membrane pressure injuries (HR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09-1.68), whereas high C-reactive protein levels, although not statistically significant (HR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.91-1.30), suggested a potential promoting effect.\n\nNutrition risk was an independent risk factor for oral mucosal membrane pressure injuries in critically ill patients with endotracheal tubes. Medical nutrition therapy reduced this risk, particularly with longer durations. Additionally, elevated procalcitonin levels were associated with a higher risk, highlighting the role of inflammation in pressure injury development.",

A mediation Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach was employed to assess the correlation between immune cells and sepsis, along with the mediating effects of inflammatory proteins in this relationship. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method, with MR-Egger and weighted median serving as supplements in the preliminary MR. Sensitivity analyses were implemented using Cochrane Q test, MR-Egger intercept, Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier and leave-one-out analysis. Subsequently, we performed replication MR, meta-analysis, Reverse MR, and linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression to thoroughly verify causation. In addition, we explored whether inflammatory proteins act as mediating factors in the pathway from the immune cells to sepsis. After conducting a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts, there were 4 risk and 7 protective causal effects between genetic liability in immune cells and sepsis, with no evidence of reverse causality. Among the 92 inflammatory proteins investigated, only 2 were found to be associated with sepsis. However, inflammatory proteins did not act as mediating factors. This study elucidated the critical role of specific immune cell traits in the progression of sepsis. Our findings provide a foundation for future research into targeted immunomodulatory therapies, potentially improving patient outcomes in sepsis, and offering new insights into the complex immunological dynamics of this condition.",

This study focused on the correlation between CLR and TBS and the mediating effect of BMI based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2008. This study used data from the NHANES database (1789 males and 1699 females) to perform multivariate logistic regression, population characterization, and subgroup and interaction analyses to estimate the relationship between CLR and TBS, and explored the mediating role of BMI on the correlation between CLR and TBS through mediation analysis. A total of 3488 participants aged 20 years and older were recruited for this study. Multivariate regression analysis showed that those with a high CLR had a low TBS. Mediation analyses showed that CLR had a large direct effect on TBS (P < .0001) and that BMI partially mediated this relationship (55.2148%, P < .0001). This study found that increased levels of CLR were associated with decreased TBS and were influenced by BMI. CLR may be a valuable tool for assessing bone metabolism and deserves further exploration.

A Melissopalynological procedure was used to identify floral origin while proximate and mineral contents were analyzed by standard methods. Five major bee floras namely Bidens spp., Guizotia scabra, Croton macrostachyus, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Zea mays were identified and analyzed. The proximate composition results showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) among the tested bee pollen. The results indicated the mean content of Moisture (13.29%), Ash (2.03%), Fat (4.27%), Protein (17.76%), Fiber (2.68%), and Carbohydrate (59.94%). All bee pollen types exhibited statistically significant (p < 0.05) on minerals except on Mn (p > 0.05). The mean content of K (5368.4), P (2537.5), Fe (91.4), Mn (30.9) and Na (144.7) mg/kg in dry weight was observed. Z. mays had the highest moisture and protein content, E. camaldulensis had the highest ash and K content, while the highest P, Fe and Na was recorded by C. macrostachyus pollen sample. From the minerals, the highest and lowest amount was K (5368.4 mg/kg) and Mn (30.9 mg/kg) respectively. The findings indicated the tested floral based bee pollen had an excellent proximate and mineral content whilst their amount varies based on the source of flora.

These endogenously expressed molecules exhibit significant evolutionary conservation, a feature vital for identifying new conserved miRNAs across various plant and animal species. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa Linn.), a member of the Asteraceae family, stands out as a leafy vegetable with exceptional nutritional value. Given its significance, this study aimed to discover and describe new conserved miRNAs in lettuce. The investigation employed computational techniques to explore the lettuce genome leading to the identification of 27 conserved miRNAs from 27 families. Notably, three clusters of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), including lsa-MIR165, lsa-MIR168, and lsa-MIR3630, were also identified. To validate the computational predictions, seven randomly selected miRNAs were experimentally validated using RT-PCR. Additionally, the study delved into the protein targets of the identified miRNAs, resulting in the identification of 74 protein targets associated with 97 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and significant biological processes. The computational analysis of targets also shed light on their potential roles in post-transcriptional regulation. The presence of three precursor miRNA clusters suggested coordinated regulatory functions. The identification of conserved miRNAs and their associated protein targets opens avenues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory processes in this economically significant leafy vegetable and the knowledge gained from this research lays the groundwork for potential applications in modulating miRNAs to control desired features in lettuce, thereby contributing to the improvement of this essential crop.",

Understanding genetic diversity and conserving wheat germplasm is essential for developing cultivars resilient to climate change. This study investigates grain quality, nutritional profiles, and genetic diversity across a selection of Egyptian and internationally sourced wheat cultivars. Physical and chemical analyses were conducted to assess grain/flour quality, hardness, and micronutrient content. Genetic diversity was evaluated using protein profiling, SCoT markers, and rbcL chloroplast DNA barcoding, chosen for its highly conserved nature and proven utility in plant species identification and phylogenetic analysis, making it a reliable marker for assessing genetic relationships among wheat cultivars. The findings from this study revealed distinct patterns of genetic variation and highlight valuable traits within the germplasm, providing crucial information for developing wheat cultivars adapted to diverse climatic conditions.\n\nPhysical and biochemical analyses revealed that two Egyptian cultivars, Sohag 5 and Misr 1, exhibited superior quality and nutritional value among the nine evaluated wheat cultivars. Both showed favorable physical properties (e.g., grain weight, falling number, gluten content). Sohag 5 was notably rich in carbohydrates, protein content, and essential minerals (zinc, calcium, magnesium), while Misr 1 also maintained healthy carbohydrate and gluten levels. Genetic diversity analysis, employing SDS-PAGE protein profiling and SCoT markers, effectively differentiated the wheat cultivars. These molecular markers consistently grouped the cultivars, generally distinguished between bread wheat and durum wheat varieties, and provided insights into the genetic relationships between Egyptian and imported lines. While the specific clustering patterns varied between marker types, particularly with rbcL sequences providing a distinct grouping since the rbcL chloroplast gene exhibited limited resolution for differentiating closely related cultivars. The combined genetic data confirmed significant diversity within the germplasm. Overall, the analysis identified two primary genetic groups among the cultivars, with Group I comprising seven diverse cultivars and Group II containing two distinct cultivars (Benisuif 6 and Sohag 5).\n\nOverall, the investigated Egyptian wheat cultivars demonstrated competitive or superior performance in standard physical and nutritional parameters compared to the imported varieties, with Sohag 5 and Misr 1 notably excelling in grain quality and micronutrient content. The genetic diversity analysis, incorporating protein profiling, SCoT markers, and rbcL chloroplast DNA barcoding, effectively characterized the genetic landscape of the cultivars. A key finding was the consistent genetic distinction of specific Egyptian cultivars, notably Sohag 5 and Benisuif 6, which clustered uniquely, aligning with their classification as durum wheat varieties. This revealed genetic relationships, alongside the identified superior traits (e.g., in Sohag 5), provides valuable insights that can be strategically utilized in breeding programs to develop new wheat cultivars with enhanced quality and adaptability to diverse climatic conditions.",

    "combined_text": "The Synergistic Interplay between Vitamin A, Dietary Fiber, and the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: A Potential Mechanism for Preventing Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nThe human gastrointestinal tract harbors a vast and diverse microbial community, with the gut microbiome playing a fundamental role in numerous biological processes that influence overall health and disease progression. Emerging evidence has identified bacterial lipopolysaccharides in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, highlighting the intricate relationship between the gastrointestinal tract, gut microbiome, and the central and enteric nervous systems-commonly referred to as the \"microbiota-gut-brain axis.\" In this review, we explore the mechanisms by which the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to AD pathogenesis. We propose that sufficient levels of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the bioactive form of vitamin A, enhance intestinal barrier integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins and modulating immune function through the induction of regulatory T-cell differentiation, thereby mitigating inflammation. Furthermore, dietary fiber complements this process by promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, via bacterial fermentation. Butyrate, in turn, acts as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, upregulating ATRA bioavailability by elevating aldehyde dehydrogenase gene expression. Our mechanistic framework is supported by the endotoxin hypothesis of AD, which purports that the movement of infectious pathogens across the blood-brain barrier causes a vicious cycle of neuroinflammation, a key factor of AD pathogenesis, leading to amyloid-beta deposition, microglial activation, and CYP26A1-mediated ATRA degradation. Finally, we discuss microbiome-based therapeutic strategies and dietary interventions, including prebiotic compounds, probiotic bacteria, fecal microbiota transplantation, the MIND diet, and a combined approach consisting of vitamins A/D, and dietary fiber, as potential approaches to mitigate AD progression via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

    "combined_text": "Inhibition of Advanced Glycation End-products by the vitamin B6 vitamer pyridoxamine prevents systemic and skeletal muscle diet-induced metaflammation through modulation of S1P/RhoA/ROCK signalling.\n\nThe typical western diet contributes to the accumulation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs), reactive compounds involved in metabolic alterations and low-grade inflammation, referred as metaflammation. AGEs affect sphingolipid metabolism increasing sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is in turn induces pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization through activation of RhoA/ROCK. The current study seeks to determine whether inhibition of AGEs by the anti-glycating vitamin B6 analog pyridoxamine prevents metaflammation via modulation of S1P/RhoA/ROCK signalling. Gastrocnemius muscle was obtained from mice fed a standard diet (SD) or a western diet (WD), supplemented or not with pyridoxamine (WD+PYR, 150mg/kg bw/day). Metabolic and inflammatory profiles have been investigated in plasma, while accumulation of AGE-modified proteins, expression of RAGE, S1P-synthesizing enzymes and S1P receptors, as well as activation of RhoA/ROCK/IRS-1 pathway have been analysed in gastrocnemius muscle. Markers of local inflammatory cells infiltration and macrophage polarization were also explored. In comparison to SD mice, WD mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and muscle lipid accumulation with increased plasma proinflammatory cytokines and muscle M1-polarized macrophage infiltration. WD mice muscle showed higher content of AGE-modified proteins with increased S1P synthesis and S1PR1 expression, paralleled by activation of RhoA/ROCK and impairment of insulin signalling. By inhibiting AGEs production through pyridoxamine supplementation, all the WD-induced metabolic and inflammatory signalling alterations were significantly reversed towards the SD state. The present findings confirm a relevant role for AGE/S1P/RhoA/ROCK signalling in diet-induced metaflammation, suggesting the formulation of pharmacological and nutraceutical tools to prevent AGEs accumulation as a useful strategy against obesity-related metabolic and inflammatory diseases.",

This study combined molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to investigate hotspot residues and epitopes of goat α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG). Energy calculations showed that Phe31 and Gln35 played key roles in binding of α-LA and β-LG to IgG.

Hydrolysis of goat whey protein by alcalase reduced the antigenicity of α-LA and β-LG by 59.27 % and 33.21 %, respectively.

This review examines their interaction with flavour compounds, highlighting the effect of chemical bonding and processing factors on altering protein binding sites and flavour perception. A key challenge with PPI is the presence of negative flavours, like beany and bitter, which can limit its application in food formulation. Protein-focused strategies for mitigating these undesirable flavours are also discussed. While most research has focused on model systems using PPI solutions, studies incorporating PPI within food matrices have also been included where possible, to provide an authentic understanding of flavours in formulated products. By integrating current findings from both analytical and sensory studies, this review aims to outline PPI's role in improving flavour quality in food development.",

While waxy endosperms arising from non-functional waxy (wx) allele leading to the absence of Granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) enzyme have been identified in sorghum, their broader effects on seed development and grain quality remain inadequately understood. To address this gap, we identified a novel wx loss-of-function allele, \"wxe\" in the mutant population of the sorghum reference genome line BTx623. Beyond reduced amylose content, wxe exhibited increased kernel hardness, elevated protein content, reduced endosperm-to-germ ratio, and decreased kernel weight compared to the wild-type. Integrating transcriptomic, metabolomic, and seed chemistry analyses revealed coordinated regulatory changes during seed development due to disrupted amylose synthesis. This included altered starch granule structure, enhanced lipid profiles, and reduced carbohydrate content. Differentially expressed genes and transcription factors related to starch metabolism provided insights into the regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, metabolic profiling showed significant changes in the accumulation of compounds influencing flavor and nutritional properties.

However, elucidating the metabolic capabilities and genetic determinants of biodegrading strains is crucial for optimizing bioremediation strategies. In this study, we comprehensively characterize the aromatic catabolic potential of two indigenous bacterial isolates, A. xylosoxidans C2 (A. x. C2) and A. xylosoxidans KW38 (A. x. KW38), obtained from hydrocarbon-impacted environments in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Experimental validation through aromatic hydrocarbons supplemented growth studies confirmed the capability of the isolated bacteria to mineralize bisphenol A, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 1-naphthalenemethanol, and the high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), pyrene, in the presence of glucose. Their degradation efficiencies were comparable to or greater than those of Pseudomonas paraeruginosa, a well-characterized model organism for aromatic compound degradation. Integrated bioinformatic analyses uncovered fundamental aromatic catabolic pathways conserved across Achromobacter species, along with strain-specific genes that potentially confer specialized degradative capacities, highlighting the genomic basis of the observed metabolic versatility. Further, protein modeling based on the curated sequences revealed unique features of individual catabolic enzymes and their interaction networks. Notably, a dehydrogenase enzyme involved in aromatic ring cleavage was identified exclusively in these UAE isolates. These findings establish A. x. C2 and A. x. KW38 as promising bioremediators of diverse aromatic pollutants. Overall, the study exemplifies a powerful and comprehensive methodological framework that bridges bioinformatic analysis and experimental research to further optimize the effectiveness of experimental design. We achieved a substantial reduction in the number of unknown genetic and metabolic determinants of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation in the strains, reducing uncertainty by 99.3%, thereby enhancing the overall process and outcomes for systematic biodiscovery of pollutant-degrading environmental microbes to address ecological challenges.",

    "combined_text": "The Effect of the Inflammatory Microenvironment on Odontogenic Differentiation of Dental Pulp Stem Cells.\n\nThe dental pulp not only serves as the tooth's nutritional core but also creates a finely tuned microenvironment that is enriched with blood vessels, nerves, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules, all of which guide the fate of resident dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Trauma and microbial invasion disrupt this niche, leading to pulpitis and necrosis. Although conventional root canal treatment preserves the tooth's structure by removing infected pulp, it can increase tooth brittleness and impede root development in immature permanent teeth. Harnessing DPSCs' multipotency for pulp regeneration promises to restore the natural pulp-dentin complex in situ. Importantly, DPSCs encounter an inflammatory microenvironment composed of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, a spectrum of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, diverse immune cell phenotypes, and altered matrix signals. While earlier work examined the isolated effects of mediators such as lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or macrophage-derived exosomes on odontogenic differentiation, this review focuses on how these mediators collectively interact in both synergistic and antagonistic ways within the inflammatory niche. We systematically delineate how these collective stimuli converge on wingless/integrated/beta-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and bone morphogenetic protein/Sma and Mad related protein pathways to modulate key odontogenic markers (runt-related transcription factor 2, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, alkaline phosphatase) and mineralization outcomes. By applying a microenvironment-centric lens, we reveal novel targets and strategies to recalibrate inflammation, steer DPSCs toward reparative odontogenesis, and ultimately enhance the efficacy of regenerative endodontic therapies.",

    "combined_text": "MR Promotes Ferroptosis in Gastric Cancer by Regulating FANCD2 Expression Mediated by m6A Modification.\n\nOur previous work points out that methionine restriction (MR) treatment inhibits gastric cancer progression. Ferroptosis is a new form of cell death, and induction of ferroptosis has an inhibitory effect on tumors. Silencing of the ferroptosis inhibitory molecule FA complementation group D2 protein (FANCD2) has been reported to inhibit tumor growth. This investigation aims to explore whether MR treatment affects ferroptosis of gastric cancer cells by regulating FANCD2 expression, and thus affects the advancement of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer cells (AGS and HGC27) were cultured in MR condition. For ferroptosis detection, lipid ROS was examined by fluorescent staining; ACSL4 levels were estimated by western blot; malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) levels were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Transfection of FANCD2/METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) overexpression plasmids was to conduct in gain of function tests. SRAMP analysis was to predict the m6A methylation site of FANCD2, with methylated RNA immunoprecipitation detection of m6A levels of FANCD2 mRNA, and Actinomycin D experiments to evaluate its stability. Gastric cancer cells were administered through tail vein injection into BALB/c mice to conduct transplanted tumor models, and mice were given an MR diet or combined with an injection of oeFANCD2/oeMETTL3 lentivirus. The effect of FANCD2/METTL3 overexpression on tumor volume and ferroptosis was measured. The gastric cancer patient-derived organoids were also cultured and treated with MR, and the diameter was analyzed. MR treatment increased ferroptosis and reduced the volume of tumor tissue. FANCD2 levels were found to change dramatically following MR treatment, and overexpressing FANCD2 inhibited ferroptosis and promoted tumor formation. In addition, MR treatment decreased FANCD2 m6A abundance as well as FANCD2 mRNA stability. Database predictions suggested that METTL3 may be an m6A regulatory molecule influenced by MR, and our results showed that METTL3 was down-regulated under MR conditions, and METTL3 overexpression increased the m6A abundance and stability of FANCD2 mRNA. Further results showed that overexpressing METTL3 reduced ferroptosis-related indexes and increased the tumor volume, inhibiting METTL3 reversed the results. Furthermore, MR reduced the diameter of gastric cancer organoids. MR inhibits FANCD2 m6A levels and FANCD2 stability by inhibiting METTL3 expression, and then promotes ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells.",

We report a reflective holographic sensor that can directly detect diluted milk by monitoring the shrinkage of the holographic grating, which induces a rapid and reversible blue shift of 34 nm across milk dilutions ranging from 10 to 100 vol%. The holographic milk sensor demonstrates high selectivity, remaining unaffected by variations in fat content, ionic strength, or pH. Testing with various casein suspensions reveals that the shrinkage effect is specifically triggered by calcium caseinate micelles, in marked contrast to free casein slurries in water. Moreover, adding melamine to artificially compensate for the nitrogen loss in diluted milk results in swelling rather than contraction.

Methotrexate promotes AMPK activation by inhibiting 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (ZMP) formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate (IMP) cyclohydrolase (ATIC), which converts ZMP, an endogenous purine precursor and an active form of the pharmacological AMPK activator AICAR, to IMP during de novo purine synthesis. In addition to methotrexate, inhibition of purine synthesis underpins the therapeutic effects of a number of commonly used immunosuppressive, anticancer, and antimicrobial drugs, raising the question of whether activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle could be a recurrent feature of these drugs. Using L6 myotubes, we found that AICAR-induced AMPK activation and glucose uptake were enhanced by inhibitors of the conversion of IMP to GMP (mycophenolate mofetil) or of IMP to AMP (alanosine) as well as by indirect inhibitors of human (trimetrexate) and bacterial ATIC (sulfamethoxazole). 6-Mercaptopurine, which inhibits the conversion of IMP to GMP and AMP, activated AMPK, increased glucose uptake, and suppressed insulin signaling, but did not enhance the effect of AICAR. As determined by measuring oxygen consumption rate, none of these agents suppressed mitochondrial function. Overall, our results indicate that IMP metabolism is a gateway for the modulation of AMPK and its metabolic effects in skeletal muscle cells.",

A microfluidic platform was used for droplet generation and single droplet analysis, assessing the impact of protein blending on droplet size and shape eccentricity after droplet generation. Drop tensiometry complemented the microfluidics-based analysis by evaluating interfacial tension and viscoelastic properties of the various interfaces. The presence of FPI altered WPI interfaces; in mixed systems, antagonistic interactions between proteins resulted in a decreased elastic modulus and broadening of the shape eccentricity. Mixed systems resulted in smaller droplets with narrower size distributions and increased resistance to short-term coalescence with respect to emulsion droplets stabilized by FPI alone, and droplet stability increased proportionally with WPI/FPI ratio.",

We uncovered casein kinase 1 delta (CK1δ) as a central mediator of this dysfunction, acting via phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SNAPIN. Vpr-induced CK1δ activation leads to hyperphosphorylation of SNAPIN, disrupting lysosomal positioning and motility. These defects are rescued by selective CK1δ inhibition, which restores lysosomal acidification, positioning, and mitophagy.

While moderate plant protein intake might be beneficial in early CKD, our findings in advanced stages were largely non-significant and require confirmation in larger studies before clinical recommendations can be made. These findings support a more nuanced approach to dietary protein source management in CKD, though further prospective studies are needed to confirm these associations.",

    "combined_text": "Utilization of bottom-up approaches to produce plant-based milk analogs: a review of compositional, structural, physicochemical, functional, and nutritional properties.\n\nPlant-based foods and beverages, particularly milk analogs, are gaining increasing popularity for various reasons, including environmental, ethical, and health concerns. Currently, the market offers a wide range of plant-based milk analogs (PBMAs), most of which are manufactured using top-down methods that involve the mechanical disruption of plant tissues to create an aqueous dispersion of small particles, such as those found in soy, oat, coconut, or almond milks. However, PBMAs can also be constructed using bottom-up approaches, which involve homogenizing water, a plant-based oil, and a plant-based emulsifier together to produce a milk-like colloidal dispersion containing emulsifier-coated oil droplets dispersed in water. The plant-based oils used for this purpose include corn, flaxseed, olive, safflower, sunflower, and vegetable oils, while the plant-based emulsifiers include amphiphilic proteins, polysaccharides, and phospholipids. This article provides a comprehensive review of PBMAs prepared using the bottom-up method, including fabrication methods, ingredient functionality, and product design. In particular, the design of PBMAs with structural, physicochemical, functional, nutritional, and sensory properties similar to those of cow's milk is emphasized. In addition, the article highlights the feasibility of using PBMAs produced using the bottom-up method to create other kinds of plant-based dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt, cream, ice cream, and butter. This is typically done by creating plant-based analogs of milk fat globules and casein micelles. One of the key advantages of the bottom-up approach is that the physicochemical, functional, and nutritional properties of PBMAs can be carefully controlled, which can increase their performance and versatility. However, several technical challenges still remain, such as the need to better match the gelling, foaming, and nutritional properties of cow's milk, which will require further research.",

    "combined_text": "Positive selection at core genes may underlie niche adaptation in Fusobacterium animalis.\n\nFusobacterium animalis (Fa) was identified as the most enriched Fusobacterium species in colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, a group of Fa core genes were found to be highly expressed intratumorally and to favor intracellular survival. We hypothesized that, because they promote bacterial fitness in the intracellular niche, these genes might be targets of positive selection, a process that often underlies adaptation to variable environments.\n\nWe performed an evolutionary analysis to identify selective events that occurred over different time frames, namely during the divergence of the Fusobacterium species and in the more recent separation of the Fa lineage from F. paranimalis. Results indicated that the coding sequences of these genes have been targeted by intense purifying selection, possibly as the result of their often-essential functions. However, localized signatures of positive selection were also detectable. During the divergence of Fusobacterium species, the major target of positive selection was represented by elongation factor-Tu, a finding that may be related to its moonlighting functions in adhesion and biofilm development. Additional targets were RpoC and the septum-determining protein MinD. We suggest that variations in the latter contribute to the observed differences in cell length and width between F. watanabei and Fa. We also searched for and detected beneficial changes that occurred specifically in the Fa lineage, suggesting that such variants promote intracellular growth or adaptation to the tumor microenvironment. The strongest target of selection was DnaK, which was shown to promote malignant transformation in other bacterial systems. Analysis of the selected sites in DnaK indicated that most of them are located in the C-terminal unstructured region and that they determine the appearance of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs). Specifically, one ELM is a casein kinase 2 phosphorylation site, whereas two additional ELMs are involved in SUMOylation and USP7-mediated deubiquitination. USP is a central modulator of the p53-MDM2 pathway and we propose that SUMOylation facilitates the nuclear import of Fa DnaK where USP7 promotes its stability.\n\nWe identified specific proteins and amino acid changes that are expected to underlie phenotypic diversity in Fusobacteria. These data are relevant to inform future analyses of Fa oncogenic potential.",

This review systematically outlines essential components of CKD care from A to Z, offering evidence-based guidance to enhance patient management. Anemia treatment emphasizes iron supplementation, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and novel hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. Achieving optimal blood pressure control through renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and calcium channel blockers reduces cardiovascular risk and delays CKD progression. Cardiovascular risk management includes statins combined with ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, along with appropriate anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation. Individualized glycemic control strategies prioritize sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for their cardiovascular and renal protective effects. Vigilance in avoiding nephrotoxic agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, aminoglycosides, and contrast media, is essential for preventing renal injury. Rigorous management of electrolytes and acid-base disturbances, involving dietary sodium and potassium restrictions, phosphate binders, and bicarbonate supplementation, reduces CKD progression and related complications. Appropriate fluid management through dietary sodium and water restriction with individualized diuretic therapy prevents volume overload and associated cardiovascular complications. Nutritional interventions, particularly low-protein diets supplemented with ketoanalogues of amino acids, effectively delay CKD progression and control metabolic disturbances. Therapies addressing CKD-related mineral and bone disorders, including phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, and calcimimetics, reduce the risk of vascular calcification. In addition, lipid-lowering therapies, anticoagulation therapy, optimal vascular access management for dialysis, and early detection of arrhythmias and thrombotic microangiopathy significantly enhance patient outcomes. Attention to quality-of-life issues, such as alleviating xerosis symptoms, promoting optimal body mass index through weight management strategies, and providing psychosocial support, further enhances patient-centered care.

Through systematic evaluation of SPI-based composite gel substitution levels (0, 50, 75, and 100 %) on quality parameters, we demonstrated that this biomimetic system significantly enhanced moisture content, protein levels, pH, L* and a*, while reducing total fat, calories, cooking loss, and lipid oxidation.

Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging evaluations confirmed an improved water-holding capacity and uniform water distribution. This optimal formulation demonstrated enhanced water-holding capacity (89.47 ± 2.34 %), reduced cooking losses (9.39 ± 0.69 %), and achieved superior sensory acceptance (82.2 ± 4.97). Therefore, the SPI-based composite gel functions as a viable nutritional fat substitute in the production of low-fat, high-quality emulsified sausages without compromising textural or sensory attributes.

Our results showed that the addition of C. pilosula agro-waste to the ration decreased muscle fibre diameter and cross-sectional area. In addition, the addition of C. pilosula agro-waste to the ration slowed down the rapid decrease of pH during postmortem. Meanwhile, it enhances the antioxidant capacity of muscle, coordinates the energy metabolic cycle to reduce the shear force value, and thereby improves meat quality.

This study investigated the effects of digests from oxidized MPs collected from bighead carp on Caco-2 cell viability, oxidative and inflammatory responses. The intestinal transport of peptides in these digests was studied using a model of Caco-2 simulated intestinal epithelial layer. Results suggest that treatment with digests of oxidized MPs not only induces ROS and inflammatory stress of Caco-2 cells (evidenced by increased ROS levels, increased mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β, and decreased enzyme activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx), but also negatively affects cell viability. Moreover, protein oxidation altered peptide transport characteristics across the Caco-2 monolayer, resulting in lower permeability of bioactive peptides. These findings underscore the impact of exposure to oxidized protein digests on cellular health and provide insights into the potential risks of consuming oxidized MPs.",

Inflammation alters junction proteins, resulting in increased permeability, and may also influence the response pattern of barrier proteins responsible for intracellular nutrient transport. Focusing on the MFSD2a protein (major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2 A), which is present in the BBB, is an important translocator of omega-3 fatty acid (ω3) from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS), this study aimed to assess the impact of obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HF) on the MFSD2a modulation in the hypothalamus of mice. Male Swiss mice were subjected to HF, and after the onset of obesity, the MFSD2a gene expression, protein content, and their distribution through the hypothalamic areas were measured. Also, obese animals were treated with ω3-rich oil orally to measure the ω3 translocation to the brain. Palmitate or TNFα was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) to test the mechanism enrolled on MFSD2a modulation. Surprisingly, MFSD2a was increased in the hypothalamic MFSD2a induced by HF consumption. The biomolecular mapping showed wide MFSD2a distribution throughout the different hypothalamic nuclei but increased in arcuate and paraventricular nucleus induced by HF-diet. The ω3 translocator is modulated over the animal's lifetime under both CT and HF diets. The i.c.v. administration of TNFα or palmitic did not alter the translocator, thus, the mechanistic influence of obesity on MFSD2a is still open. The supply of ω3-rich oils to obese mice had no impact on their central bioaccessibility. These nutrigenomic approaches revealed that not only the obesogenic process impacts the MFSD2a protein in the hypothalamus but also environmental and life circumstances.",

Radio frequency (RF) heating has shown potential to enhance rice flour quality by modulating gelatinization. However, the dynamic evolution of physicochemical properties and the associated structural transitions during RF-induced gelatinization remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated effects of RF treatment at 6 target temperatures (34, 39, 48, 54, 63, and 72 °C) under the corresponding gelatinization degree (GD) levels (15 %, 30 %, 45 %, 60 %, 75 %, and 90 %) on structures and physicochemical properties of protein and starch in rice flour. Results showed that physicochemical properties and structural changes of rice flour were closely associated with the GD during RF-induced gelatinization. With increasing GD of rice flour, functional properties (swelling power, foaming capacity, and emulsifying capacity), pasting viscosity (peak, trough, and final viscosity) and nutritional components (total protein, crude fat, and amylose content) showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, peaking at moderate gelatinization (45 or 60 % GD) levels. Structural analysis revealed that the increased GD of rice flour promoted protein aggregation on the surface of starch particles, reduced values of short-range ordered structure, relative crystallinity, and enthalpy values, and altered secondary and tertiary structures of proteins. This study may elucidate the correlation mechanism between structure and performance during RF-induced gelatinization, providing a theoretical basis for the application of RF technology in the modification of gluten-free rice flour.",

Moreover, MDS revealed that the interaction with PC-DHA increased the solvent contact area and irregularly curled structure of myosin, giving myosin a higher solvent-accessible surface area and more contact sites. These structural changes promoted improved gelling and emulsifying properties of myosin.

Due to its smaller molecular size, catechin more easily penetrated the hydrophobic cores of proteins, yielding higher binding stoichiometry and concentration-dependent aggregation. At 4 mM, extensive aggregation masked proteolytic cleavage sites, reducing gastrointestinal digestibility by 7.3 % for 7S and 15.1 % for 11S. In contrast, EGCG, with an additional galloyl moiety and a denser hydroxyl network, interacted with proteins through synergistic hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic forces. It produced more stable supramolecular complexes with much larger diameters (462.2 ± 6.8 nm for 11S-EGCG, versus 30.3 ± 1.5 nm for native 11S), and lowered IgE-binding capacity by approximately 19.5-38.7 %, probably through epitope masking and surface-charge changes. For both polyphenols, binding significantly decreased solvent accessibility of hydrophobic regions, reorganized secondary structure (α-helix loss and β-sheet gain), and markedly enhanced intrinsic antioxidant capacity.

Moreover, the addition of Arg significantly enhanced the stability of the emulsions, with those prepared at 30 °C exhibiting the highest stability. These findings could be attributed to the fact that under the stirring temperature of 30 °C and in the presence of Arg, the depolymerization of gelatin increased, leading to a significant increase in the hydrophobic β-sheet structures (P < 0.05), which in turn resulted in a significant increase in the exposure of hydrophobic amino acids and negatively charged residues on the gelatin surface (P < 0.05).

Marine-derived glycoproteins have received widespread attention for multiple activities and due to their lack of side effects, but sea cucumber glycoproteins (SCGP) and their hypoglycemic mechanisms remain unexplored. In this study, SCGP was investigated for its effects on the hepatic and intestinal glucose metabolism transport mechanisms by establishing a PDM mouse model through high-fat and high-sugar diet feeding. The results demonstrated that SCGP could restore fasting glucose and oral glucose tolerance to normal levels, improve postprandial glucose, insulin resistance and lipid levels, and enhance insulin sensitivity in PDM mice. Additionally, the results demonstrated that SCGP improved hepatic glucose metabolism by up-regulating the INSR/PI3K/AKT pathway, which could also alleviate insulin resistance. Moreover, SCGP promoted the intestinal barrier by upregulating zonula occludin and mucin 2, and it enhanced small intestine glucose transport and absorption by regulating the PLCβ2/PKCα/SGLT1-GLUT2 pathway. Furthermore, SCGP regulated the abundance of Lactobacillus, Roseburia and Faecalibaculum linked to DM at the genus level. Overall, this study demonstrated the potential of SCGP in intervening in hyperglycemia, preventing PDM from developing into DM, which provides a theoretical foundation for the development of natural functional products related to the intervention of PDM.",

In this study, peanut meal (PM) was enzymatically hydrolyzed using three proteases and fractionated by ultrafiltration. Among the resulting fractions, peanut peptide (PEP) in the 3 kDa-500 Da range demonstrated superior α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (69.5 %), peptide yield (85.75 %), and peptide content (1.55 ± 0.05 mg/mL). In a high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes (T2DM) mouse model, high-dose PEP (PEP-H) effectively reduced blood glucose and lipid levels, alleviated liver damage, and relieved the symptoms of T2DM. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses revealed that PEP modulated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism via the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway. Finally, four peptides (AFPKFR, APPFDPNKPK, PFPIK, and FATPVPLPK) exhibiting the strongest α-glucosidase-binding ability were identified from PEP using LC-MS/MS and molecular docking analysis. Notably, APPFDPNKPK and FATPVPLPK exhibited the highest inhibitory activity (64.3 % and 75.4 %, respectively) via mixed-type inhibition. This study highlights a novel value-added strategy for the utilization of PM proteins and provides essential peptide candidates for developing innovative antidiabetic drugs and functional foods.",

The incorporation of Qingke powder into soybean paste enhances both its flavor and nutritional profile. However, there is a need to deepen the understanding of how microbial communities and physicochemical changes contribute to the flavor and nutritional characteristics of Qingke-based fermented products. This study investigated the physicochemical properties, volatile compounds, and microbial community dynamics in Qingke bean paste (QBP) throughout the fermentation process. Significant increases in titratable acid, amino acid content, and enzyme activity were observed over the fermentation period. The dominant microorganisms identified included Bacillus, Pediococcus, Issatchenkia, and Aspergillus. Although the abundance of both Bacillus and Aspergillus gradually decreased, the abundance of Pediococcus and Issatchenkia increased. Redundancy analysis revealed salinity and moisture as the primary factors driving microbial community changes. Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated a strong positive relationship between the volatile compounds in QBP and the presence of Bacillus and Issatchenkia, indicating their key roles in flavor development. This study provides valuable insights into the taxonomic shifts in microbial communities and the formation of flavor metabolites during QBP fermentation, offering a foundation for further advancements in the processing of Qingke-based products.",

However, current 3D food printers face challenges in achieving large-scale production due to their slow printing speeds and low printing efficiency. In this study, hydrocolloids including gelatin (GL), xanthan gum (XG), and flaxseed gum (FG) were incorporated into the existing strawberry and pea protein isolate (PPI) gel and a multi-nozzle printer was designed, aiming to achieve highly efficient 3D food printing. Results showed that the incorporation of hydrocolloids enhanced the optimal printing speed from 20 mm/s to 50 mm/s, while the utilization of a multi-nozzle printer decreased the time required to produce a printing product from 610 s to 58 s. Moreover, there was no noticeable difference in appearance or size for the dual-nozzle and six-nozzle printing products. The hydrocolloids (GL and FG) enhanced the rheological properties and textural structure of the strawberry-PPI gels by increasing the bound water content, which improved the mechanical properties and 3D printing performance. The extruded filament surface of strawberry-PPI gels became smoother and the internal structure of the gels became denser with the incorporation of hydrocolloids. The results from the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) indicated that the 3D printed products met the requirements for level-4 dysphagia foods. It can be concluded that both the incorporation of hydrocolloids and the development of multi-nozzle fixtures can enhance printing speed and facilitate large-scale production, offering valuable insights for the future of efficient 3D food printing.",

The efficacy of germinated red bean extract and its bioactive compound, azukisaponin II (AZ), on anti-obesity has been reported very little to date. This study aims to investigate the anti-obesity effects of red bean seedling extract (RS) and AZ, on PPARα and AMPKα signaling pathways in white adipose tissue. RS supplementation effectively reduced fat mass and improved lipid metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice. RS decreased body weight gain, reduced adipocyte size, and lowered plasma triglyceride, free fatty acids, and total cholesterol. RS also enhanced mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation by activating AMPKα signaling and upregulating PPARα expression in white adipose tissue. In particular, the levels of lipolysis-related factors (ATGL, HSL, and PLIN5) and proteins in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (NDUFB8, SDHB, UQCRC2, MTCO1, ATP5A) were increased in the RS200 and RS300 groups. RS and AZ treatments inhibited adipogenesis and promoted lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, we confirmed that treating PPARα-knockdown 3T3-L1 cells with RS and AZ alleviates lipid accumulation by activating PPARα-AMPKα signaling. RS supplementation effectively reduces obesity in HFD-induced mice by enhancing lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function through PPARα-AMPKα signaling. Additionally, RS and AZ decrease lipid accumulation and promote mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating their potential for treating obesity and metabolic disorders with a favorable safety profile.",

However, the bioavailability of its conjugated linolenic acids, an essential factor for assessing their impact on health, remains poorly understood. This study used the harmonized in vitro protocol INFOGEST to investigate the bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil in comparison to olive oil. Bioaccessibility, key aspect of bioavailability, refers to the proportion of a nutrient released in the gastrointestinal tract and available for intestinal absorption. It was determined by measuring the ratio of fatty acids present in the absorbable fraction (monoglycerides and free fatty acids) to total fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography following solid-phase extraction. Results showed that the overall bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil was equivalent to that of olive oil. Notably, punicic acid (in pomegranate seed oil) and oleic acid (in olive oil) - both 18‑carbon fatty acids present in equivalent quantities in the two oils, showed high and equivalent bioaccessibility. The presence of proteins (whey and soy protein isolates) did not affect the bioaccessibility of the major fatty acids under experimental conditions. The recovery index was high for all fatty acids, indicating minor degradation during in vitro digestion, and was not affected by the presence of oxygen. In conclusion, punicic acid is efficiently released by digestive lipases, suggesting good bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil. This finding paves the way for its potential application in oral therapeutic use.",

In this study, we explored a promising alternative of curcumin-mediated photodynamic treatment (PDT) for the inhibition of B. cereus and the preservation of FRN quality. We optimized the processing parameters of PDT for FRN sterilization, using illumination at 30000 lx, a curcumin solution at 40 μmol/L, and an exposure time of 18 min, through single-factor experiments and central composite response design. After treatment, PDT significantly inhibited B. cereus (P < 0.05) in FRN at low and medium contamination levels both at 4 and 30 °C, reducing it to below the maximum acceptable enumeration. Moreover, PDT inhibited the rapid proliferation of B. cereus during the first 48 and 24 h at 4 and 30 °C, respectively, preventing the bacterial population from exceeding the acceptable limit for FRN. For authentic FRN samples, the results of preservation effects indicated that PDT notably inhibited the growth of hygienic indicator bacteria, putrefactive bacteria, and foodborne pathogenic bacteria during the entire storage period at 4 °C. During this bacterial guarantee period, PDT significantly slowed the accumulation of acidity and the loss of rice aroma and flavor substances in FRN. Although it mildly caused texture profile and color deterioration, the alterations remained within the acceptable range. Moreover, negligible loss of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were observed in the PDT-treated sample. Microbiome analysis indicated that PDT reduced the relative abundance of the dominant spoilage species Lactobacillus and Lactococcus in FRN. In conclusion, PDT is an emerging non-thermal sterilization process for controlling the risk of pathogens in FRN and preserving its quality. We proposed an integrative strategy in which curcumin-mediated PDT combined with chilled storage could effectively prevent and control B. cereus contamination in FRN and enhance preservation for FRN.",

Special oilseed proteins are extracted from these special oilseeds and feature high digestibility and an acceptable flavor. They are expected to complement the deficiencies of bulk proteins and expand the plant protein resource pool. Consequently, this paper reviews the enrichment, composition, functional properties, and application status of several common special oilseed proteins (sunflower seed protein, flaxseed protein, sesame seed protein, hemp seed protein, walnut protein, and perilla seed protein). The aim is to understand the development status of special oilseed proteins comprehensively, explore effective strategies to break through their application bottlenecks, and thus expand the possibilities of their applications. At present, special oilseed proteins possess excellent nutritional and functional properties and have broad application prospects. Nevertheless, the enrichment techniques for special oilseed proteins in food processing are restricted compared to the comprehensive application systems of bulk oilseed proteins. The relatively high proportion of non-protein components in the raw materials hampers their extraction, leading to a low extraction rate. Additionally, common issues among plant proteins, such as low solubility and incomplete amino acid composition, also limit their applications. Integrating new and traditional extraction methods, formulating multiple protein combinations, and modifying functional properties will contribute to the further application of special oilseed proteins.",

Nevertheless, existing metabarcoding and metagenomic studies consistently resolve a putative beneficial Mycoplasma species as the most abundant organism in gut samples. The remaining microbiome is heavily influenced by factors such as developmental stage and water salinity. We profiled the salmon gut microbiome across 540 salmon samples in differing conditions with a view to capture the genomic diversity that can be resolved from the salmon gut. The salmon were exposed to 3 different nutritional additives: seaweed, blue mussel protein and silaged blue mussel protein, including both pre-smolts (30-60 g salmon reared in freshwater) as well as post-smolts (300-600 g salmon reared in saltwater). Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we generated a catalogue of 11 species-level bacterial MAGs from 188 input metagenome assembled genomes, with 5 species not found in other catalogues. This highlights that our understanding of salmon gut microbial diversity is still incomplete. A prevalent bacterial genome annotated as Mycoplasmoidaceae is present in adult fish, and a comparison of functions revealed significant sub-species variation. Juvenile fish have a different microbial diversity, dominated by a species of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Intermittent exposure to PTH results in bone formation being greater than bone resorption, and this effect has been harnessed through the development of agonists of the PTH and PTH-related protein type 1 receptor (PTH1R) to treat osteoporosis. Teriparatide, an analogue of the first 34 amino acids of PTH, and abaloparatide, which resembles PTH-related protein (PTHrP) in structure, are PTH1R agonists currently in clinical use. Both medications have been shown to increase bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip. Randomized controlled trials with teriparatide or abaloparatide have also provided evidence of reduction in vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. The ACTIVE trial suggested slightly greater efficacy for major osteoporotic fractures (as an exploratory end point) for abaloparatide than for teriparatide. A similar potential superiority was suggested for hip fracture in a real-world, observational study. Side effects of these medications are usually transient, and although a risk of osteosarcoma was suggested by studies using murine models, no such risk has been observed in extensive human studies. Overall, both teriparatide and abaloparatide have demonstrated convincing clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, with a reassuring safety profile. Potential differences in their effects on bone mineral density and their antifracture effects offer avenues for differentiation but require further validation in appropriately designed studies.",

Due to its complex pathogenesis, no approved pharmacological treatments currently exist. The research sought to explore the combined impact of metformin (Met) and berberine (BBR) on NAFLD, focusing on the AMPK-SREBP1-FASN pathway implicated in liver lipid regulation. The study design incorporated in both living organisms and laboratory conditions to examine how these interventions influenced NAFLD-associated metabolic abnormalities. The HFD-fed mice provided insight into systemic effects, while the OA/PA-stimulated HepG2 cells offered a controlled environment to investigate cellular mechanisms. By employing this dual approach, the researchers could thoroughly characterize the efficacy of Met, BBR, and their combination in mitigating metabolic disturbances. An Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase(AMPK) inhibitor was used in cellular experiments to verify the AMPK-dependent mechanism. Our findings highlight that compared to monotherapies, combination treatment significantly enhanced AMPK activation and inhibited sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) expression and that of its downstream target fatty acid synthase (FASN). In HepG2 cells, these effects were partially reversed by the AMPK inhibitor, confirming AMPK dependence. In vivo, the combined therapy effectively inhibited body weight gain, reduced visceral fat accumulation, improved insulin sensitivity, and attenuated hepatic steatosis and inflammation. The combination of metformin and berberine exerts synergistic effects in ameliorating NAFLD by activating AMPK, downregulating SREBP1 and FASN, and improving lipid metabolism. These findings provide evidence supporting a potentially effective multi-modal treatment approach for NAFLD.",

A feasibility study was conducted to evaluate growth, immunity and carcass traits of commercial broiler chickens fed water-distributed biosurfactants, from gastrointestinal tract derived Escherichia coli related microbe, as regular feed additives. Ninety-nine Cobb500 broiler chickens, housed in a curtained open-sided pen utilizing a deep litter system, were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments (biosurfactant based, negative -no drug added and positive control -with antibiotic drug plus NCD vaccination done), replicated thrice (11 broiler chickens per replicate). Diets were formulated from roasted soybeans and maize using trial-and-error iteration software developed by Mpofu I.D.T. The WBC differential leukocyte count was determined on 45% of the broiler chickens from each replicate using flow cytometry. To determine immune response, C-reactive protein levels and globulin concentrations (g/L) were measured using an agglutination test with Fortress Diagnostics C-reactive protein. Drip and cooking water loss were assessed as meat quality indicators. Genstat 18th edition software was used for analysis of variance of weight gain and immunity, with Fischer's LSD used to separate the means at 95% significance level. Biosurfactant supplemented feed increased body weight but had no significant effect (p > 0.05) on FCE. White blood cell counts varied significantly (p < 0.001) between treatment groups, with low levels in the biosurfactant supplemented group. The biosurfactant-supplemented group had higher moisture loss on cooking than other treatments. Endogenous biosurfactants improve the immunological properties of the Cobb 500 broiler chickens during their finishing phase.

Mechanistically, CELF1 binds to the 3'UTR of Dio2 mRNA and enhances its stability, promoting local triiodothyronine (T3) production. Notably, CELF1 expression is significantly reduced in subcutaneous fat of individuals with obesity and negatively correlates with BMI. CELF1 enhances isoproterenol-induced beige adipocyte activation and mitochondrial respiration in vitro, and Celf1 overexpression ameliorates diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Hence, our study identifies CELF1 as a physiological regulator of metabolic stress in activating thermogenesis and promoting energy expenditure at the post-transcriptional level, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic diseases.",

In this review, molecular pathways connecting SERT dysfunction associated with depression are defined, including genetic polymorphisms (e.g., 5-HTTLPR), epigenetics (e.g., SLC6A4 methylation), and environmental interactions through stress and inflammation. Using a serotonergic pharmacophore, oxidative/nitrosative stress, cytokines, and neuroendocrine factors act via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis on SERT, whereas the crosstalk between SERT and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling both bring about changes in mood and influence the response to treatment. Pharmacological treatments, such as SSRIs and SNRIs, aim at SERT; however, their effectiveness is limited due to interindividual variability. New treatments consist of allosteric modulators, multimodal antidepressants, and non-pharmacological treatments, involving exercise, diet, and microbiome manipulation. Tailor-made treatments involving the utilization of pharmacogenomics and neurobiological profiling can improve clinical outcomes. This review highlights SERT as a complex target in MDD and provides an argument in support of integrative, precision-focused interventions that aim to target the affective and cognitive symptoms of MDD.",

To investigate the role of mitochondrial chaperone tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) in this process, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic deletion to knock out (KO) TRAP1 in colon cancer cells. Depletion of TRAP1 triggered a series of events: induced metabolic reprogramming, increased glycolytic flux, downregulation of mitochondrial complex I, and elevated ROS generation. TRAP1-deficient cells showed tolerance to Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitors and exhibited a higher extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Additionally, TRAP1 depletion activated hypoxia response elements (HREs) and upregulated HIF1A target genes such as GLUT1 and MCT1. Furthermore, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 1 (PDK1) was upregulated in KO cells, leading to the inactivation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). This metabolic shift towards glycolytic metabolism resulted in increased glycolytic metabolism, elevated lactic acid production, and higher glucose consumption, making TRAP1-depleted cancer cells more dependent on this altered metabolism for survival. Treatment with DCA, a PDK inhibitor, restored PDH activity, exacerbated oxidative stress, and increased cell death in KO cells. Our study here sheds light on how TRAP1 depletion affects metabolic plasticity, driving colon cancer cells to adapt to metabolic and oxidative stress. These findings highlight TRAP1 as a promising therapeutic target for manipulating metabolic plasticity and overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy.",

Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by the gut microbiota, exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects by regulating these molecules. This discrepancy may be related to the activation or inhibition of different targets, such as G-protein-coupled receptors and histone deacetylases. This study aimed to characterize the effect of butyrate on the expression of endothelial adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and its underlying mechanism in primary bovine umbilical vein endothelial cells (BUVEC). We hypothesized that butyrate increases endothelial ICAM-1 expression, and this effect is associated with the activation of the free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) or hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2) and/or inhibition of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). BUVEC were treated with different concentrations of butyrate, and a high increase in ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) adhesion was observed at 10 mM butyrate. We found that only HCA2 was expressed in BUVEC, and its activation did not induce ICAM-1 expression. Analysis of intracellular pathways revealed that butyrate increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and its inhibition reduced butyrate-induced ICAM-1 expression. We also demonstrated that BUVEC mainly express monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and that its inhibition reduces butyrate-induced ICAM-1 expression. Finally, we demonstrated that butyrate acts as an HDAC inhibitor and MCT1 is essential for this response. Overall, these findings provide a possible mechanism for the effects of butyrate on bovine endothelial cells, which could explain the exacerbated inflammatory response during nutritional imbalance in cattle.",

Pearson correlations were used to explore clinical associations.\n\nZonulin levels were significantly decreased in the AN group at admission and again at the follow-up compared to HC. LBP levels were consistently reduced in AN across all three time points. These alterations thus persisted despite weight recovery. No significant differences were observed in iFABP levels between the groups or over time.

As humans lack a regulated excretory pathway for excess iron, systemic homeostasis depends on tightly controlled mechanisms of intestinal absorption, cellular storage, and recycling. Dysregulation of these processes may result in iron deficiency or overload, both associated with significant health implications. Plant bioactive compounds, a diverse group of secondary metabolites present in various plant tissues, have gained attention for their modulatory effects on iron metabolism. Emerging evidence suggests that these compounds influence the expression and activity of iron-regulatory proteins such as hepcidin, ferroportin (FPN), ferritin, transferrin, and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Their biological effects are frequently attributed to antioxidant, metal-chelating, and anti-inflammatory properties.

    "combined_text": "ZDHHC12 Palmitoylates HDAC8 to Promote the Progression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Associated with a Diet High in Saturated Fatty Acids.\n\nExcessive intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs)-commonly associated with diets rich in fried foods and red meat-significantly increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Palmitic acid (PA), the most prevalent type of SFA, is selected as the representative model for this study. Palmitoyltransferases play crucial roles in protein palmitoylation mediated by PA; however, the most significantly altered palmitoyltransferase under high-SFA dietary conditions remains unidentified. This study reveals zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 12 (ZDHHC12) as a key protein in PA-driven HCC progression that functions by stabilizing the oncogenic histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). Mechanistically, PA supplementation upregulates ZDHHC12 expression by activating the transcription factor SWI/SNF-related BAF chromatin remodeling complex subunit ATPase 4 (SMARCA4). ZDHHC12 mediates HDAC8 palmitoylation at cysteine 244, thereby inhibiting its lysosomal degradation and ultimately promoting HCC progression. This study reveals that ZDHHC12 is a critical mediator of PA-induced HCC progression and that targeting HDAC8 can suppress this process. These findings offer a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC patients with high dietary intake of SFAs, particularly PA.",

    "combined_text": "Airborne Ultrasound-Assisted Infrared Drying of Yellow Mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) Larvae: Nutritional Changes and Process Optimization Using Response Surface Method.\n\nThis research aims to evaluate the effect of air temperature, irradiation distance, and sonication time on dry characteristics of yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor L.) in an infrared dryer (IRD). The design of the drying experiments, which shows the relationship between the input and output variables, was conducted by the response surface method (RSM). The results showed that decreasing irradiation distance, increasing air temperature, and sonication time led to decreasing drying time and specific energy consumption (SEC). The minimum and maximum total color changes were 13.37 and 29.57, respectively. The changes in rehydration ratio (RR) of the samples increased with increasing temperature and sonication time but decreased with increasing irradiation distance, while the results were opposite for ash. The highest amount of protein and the lowest amount of fat were obtained at 70°C temperature, sonication time (30 min), and irradiation distance (15 cm), respectively. The best conditions for drying yellow mealworm include the use a temperature of 70°C, a sonication time of 25.95 min, and an irradiation distance of 11.32 cm, and by applying the optimal conditions for drying time, SEC, color, RR, fat, protein, and ash of the produced dry yellow mealworm are equal to 171.22 min, 61.45 MJ/kg, 14.28, 1.83, 29.09%, 48.13%, and 3.79%, respectively. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This research helps improve the drying process for yellow mealworms, making it faster and more energy-efficient while preserving their nutritional value. These findings can be applied in the food industry to produce high-quality insect-based protein products for human or animal consumption. Optimizing drying conditions also ensures better color, texture, and rehydration, which are important for consumer acceptance.",

In this study, the anti-sarcopenia effect of the whey protein isolate-epigallocatechin gallate (WPI-EGCG) complex and its underlying mechanisms were investigated using a D-galactose induced senescence C2C12 cell model and skeletal muscle sarcopenia mouse model. The results showed that the optimal preparation conditions of the complex were pH 5.5, reaction time 1.5 h, and WPI:EGCG = 1:2.5. Under this condition, the DPPH free radical scavenging rate of the complex was 71.61%, and the protein digestibility was 80.95%. Compared with WPI, the antioxidant activity of the complex was significantly increased by 66.23%, and the protein digestibility was significantly decreased by 5.39% (p < 0.05). After the intervention with 0.32 mol/L and 0.16 mol/L D-galactose, the cell proliferation rate of 4.0 mg/mL WPI-EGCG complex treatment was significantly increased by 63.81% and 69.92% compared with the model group (p < 0.05), respectively. In addition, gavage of a low dose WPI-EGCG complex (250 mg/kg/d.bw) significantly increased skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and muscle cross-sectional area (p < 0.05), and improved muscle mass and muscle fiber morphology in the sarcopenia mouse model compared with the model group. Compared with the model group, the low-dose WPI-EGCG complex significantly increased SOD activity by 16.14% and decreased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) content by 17.18% (p < 0.05), which was beneficial to reduce the oxidative stress level of mice. In addition, the protein expression of PI3K was increased after gavage of a low dose WPI-EGCG complex compared with the model group. After gavage of a high dose of the WPI-EGCG complex, the expression of AKT and mTOR protein was significantly increased compared with the model group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the WPI-EGCG complex ameliorated the inhibitory effect of D-galactose on protein synthesis in mouse skeletal muscle by up-regulating the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR proteins. It can promote protein anabolism in the skeletal muscle of mice, thereby improving aging-induced skeletal muscle decay. It provided new ideas for improving skeletal muscle health and quality of life in the elderly.",

The NCOR/HDAC3 complex is large and multi-component, including the transducin beta-like 1 (TBL1) and TBL1-related 1 (TBLR1) proteins. Loss of TBL1 in the hepatocytes and TBLR1 in the white adipocytes has been shown to impair fasting- and β-adrenergic-induced lipolysis. However, their roles in BAT thermogenesis remain unknown. Here, we report that deletion of TBLR1 alone in brown adipocytes does not impair the adaptive thermogenic response to prolonged cold exposure. In contrast, simultaneous deletion of TBL1 and TBLR1 dampens β-adrenergic-induced lipolysis and mitochondrial respiration in cultured mouse brown adipocytes. Transgenic mice with UCP1-Cre mediated double deletion of TBLR1 and TBL1 exhibit reduced whole-body energy expenditure during prolonged cold exposure, lower core body temperature, increased appearance of unilocular adipocytes in BAT, and suppressed expression of metabolic and myogenic PRDM16 target genes. Also, we present some evidence that TBLR1 and TBL1 interact with HDAC3 and PRDM16 in brown adipocytes, potentially suggesting a direct involvement in the PRDM16-controlled transcriptional program. These findings identify the TBLR1/TBL1 complex as a critical regulator of BAT adaptation to prolonged cold and systemic energy homeostasis, shedding light on the context-dependent functions of corepressor complexes.",

The formation and subsequent melting of ice crystals can damage muscle cells and oxidize muscle components such as protein and fat, resulting in meat quality deterioration and loss of nutritional value. This review summarizes recent studies on the effects of these processes on the water status, quality, nutrition, and digestibility of meat, which explains how the formation, growth, and recrystallization of ice crystals cause water migration, cell damage, protein oxidation, lipid oxidation, water holding capacity reduction, and nutrition degradation.

The first symptoms begin in early adulthood and include weakness and atrophy in the calves, gait abnormalities, pain and discomfort in affected muscles, and difficulty jumping or walking on tiptoes. Patients generally are diagnosed by a combination of physical exam findings, genetic testing, muscle biopsy, and elevated creatinine kinase (CK) levels. Management of the disease progression includes physical therapy to strengthen the muscles, nutritional support, occupational therapy, and assisted device education.

    "combined_text": "Insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of lysyl oxidase like 1 in cancers.\n\nCancer is one of the primary causes of human mortality and a significant barrier to increasing human life expectancy. The effective screening, early diagnosis, and treatment of cancer have long been clinical challenges, and thus new biomarkers or molecular targets must be identified to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. Lysyl oxidase like 1 (LOXL1), a secreted copper-dependent amine oxidase, is commonly expressed in a variety of cell types. LOXL1 can maintain the steady state of elastin, engage in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. LOXL1 has diverse biological functions, and its dysregulation is the basis of many clinical diseases. The abnormal expression or activation of LOXL1 can disrupt the cellular microenvironment, contributing to the development of various diseases, such as atherosclerosis, tissue damage, fibrosis, and cancer. Recent research has revealed that LOXL1 is often overexpressed in a majority of cancers, where it plays a role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis. However, some studies have also suggested that LOXL1 may have a tumor-suppressive function. Research has indicated that the LOXL1 protein is reduced in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and bladder cancer (BLCA), where it acts to suppress tumor growth. Conversely, it is upregulated in human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pleural mesothelioma (PM), brain glioma, prostate cancer (PRAD), gastric cancer (GC), breast cancer (BC), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and osteosarcoma (OS). The expression of LOXL1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a topic of debate, as it may either be upregulated or downregulated. These findings imply that LOXL1 may have a dual role in cancer, either inhibiting or facilitating carcinogenesis. This article provides a comprehensive review of the structure and function of LOXL1, along with its associations with cancer. Additionally, it explores the role of LOXL1 in tumor microenvironment remodeling, tumorigenesis, metastasis, and the molecular mechanisms that underpin these processes.",

The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in serum, as well as the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver tissue were measured. Changes in the gut microbiota of mice was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing technology. The expression levels of PPARγ, Plin2, Pck1, Acsl4, and Fads1 proteins, as well as those of zonula occludins 1 (ZO-1) and Occludin proteins in the colon tissue were detected by Western Blot.\n\nThe results showed that Sch B could alleviate the structure disorder, ballooning degeneration, inflammatory cell infiltration, liver lipid droplets, and fibrosis in liver tissue, lower the levels of AST, ALT, TG, TC, LDL-C, and LPS, increase the level of HDL-C and lower the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in serum, increase the level of IL-10, and lower the level of MDA and increase the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in liver tissue in MAFLD mice. Sch B could increase the expression levels of PPARγ, Pck1, and Fads1 proteins, but decrease Plin2 and Acsl4 proteins in liver tissue. Sch B could improve the diversity and abundance of the gut microbiota, restore the normal composition of the gut microbiota at the phylum and genus levels, alleviate the disruption of the gut barrier caused by HFD, and enhance the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin proteins in colon tissue in MAFLD mice.\n\nThis study showed Sch B can improve HFD-induced MAFLD, and the mechanism may be through regulating the PPARγ, Plin2, PCk1, Acsl4 and Fads1 signaling pathway, restoring the diversity of gut microbiota, and improving the gut barrier to delay the progression of MAFLD.",

Changes in rheological properties were attributed to the distinct interactions of proteins, which differ in their functional characteristics-such as solubility and water/oil binding capacity, and structural features, including hydrophobicity and sulfhydryl group content. The dough water absorption capacity increased from 52.6 ± 0.21% to 57.6 ± 0.33%, 55.5 ± 0.42%, and 53.1 ± 0.12% when soybean, spinach, and pumpkin leaf proteins were incorporated into wheat flour at 5% w/w, respectively. In addition to improved water absorption, changes in dough development time, dough stability, viscosity, and the shelf life of the final product were observed as a result of the incorporation of these plant proteins. A higher content of free sulfhydryl groups observed in pumpkin (49.07 ± 1.03 µmol/g protein) and spinach leaf proteins (58.19 ± 0.49 µmol/g protein) was associated with a noticeable reduction in dough development time and stability compared to soy protein, where a considerably lower free sulfhydryl content (6.21 ± 0.21 µmol/g protein) was measured. The formation of a dough with higher mixing stability was attributed to hydrophobic interactions between soy proteins and similarly hydrophobic gluten. Significantly higher polyphenol content and biological activity were exhibited by dough enriched with pumpkin and spinach leaf proteins compared to dough made with wheat flour and fortified with soy protein. In addition, the essential amino acid profile of the enriched dough was notably improved through the addition of these plant-based proteins to wheat flour.",

Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory glycoprotein naturally found in bovine colostrum and milk that is low in MR. Previous studies suggest that supplementing LF to MR enhances ADG and feed efficiency while reducing disease occurrence in pre-weaning dairy calves. In our experiment, 103 Holstein heifer calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a randomized complete block design from birth to d56 of age. Each calf received 340.1 g/d of 24% protein, 20% fat basal MR fed twice daily from d1 to 42 and once daily from d43 to 49, supplemented with 0 (L0), 1 (L1), 2 (L2) or 4 (L4) g/hd/d of LF treatment (45% purity). Calves were weaned at 49d of age. Body weight was measured at d1, 14, 28, 42, 49 and 56 of age. Faecal scores were measured weekly.

Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model with fixed effects of LF inclusion, and random effects of source herd and nursery room. In the first two weeks of life, ADG and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) were numerically (non-statistically) increased in L4 tended compared with L1 and L2, but this effect was not maintained throughout the rest of the pre-weaning period or entire experiment.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of low syncytin-1 expression on placental transport of amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol, and its implications for fetal and placental development, contributing to fetal growth restriction pathogenesis. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice received tamoxifen-induced conditional syncytin-a gene knockout at embryonic day 11.5, with controls receiving sunflower oil. Placentas and fetuses were collected analyzed for transport efficiency. Parallelly, siRNA-mediacted syncytin-1 knockdown in BeWo cells assessed trophoblast dysfunction. Nutritional content and the expression of relevant transporters for amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol, were all evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Using conditionally induced syncytin-a gene knockout mouse models, we found that syncytin-A deficiency resulted in decreased fetal and placental weights, reduced placental labyrinthine layer area and syncytiotrophoblast layer structural defects. Placental amino acid (SNAT2, LAT1), fatty acid (CD36, FABP4, FATP4), and cholesterol (LDLR, SR-B1) transporters were dysregulated, aligning with altered nutrient levels in knockout mice. Similar dysfunction in amino acid and fatty acid transport was observed in syncytin-1-silenced BeWo cells. Mechanistically, syncytin-1 deficiency suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, a key pathway modulating nutrient sensing and transporter activity. Our experiments demonstrate that syncytin-1 regulates the transport of amino acids, fatty acids and cholesterol in placental trophoblastic cells, providing new insights into the pathological role of decreased syncytin-1 in pregnancy-related disorders, particularly in fetal growth restriction.",

However, its mechanisms against BPH are still unclear.\n\nThis study aims to elucidate the active fractions of H. plantaginea flower responsible for anti-BPH effects and their underlying mechanisms.\n\nThe chemical constituents in fractions of H. plantaginea flower were rapidly identified using UHPLC-MS. The anti-BPH efficacies of the effect fractions were evaluated in testosterone propionate (TP)-induced RWPE-1 cells and rat models. Metabolomics and bioinformatics analyses were used to identify potential metabolic and signaling pathways, which were validated by Western blotting.\n\nA total of 26, 38, and 23 phytochemicals were fleetly identified from petroleum ether (HPA), ethyl acetate (HPB), and butanol (HPC) fractions, respectively. The HPA, HPB, and HPC fractions of H. plantaginea flower exhibit significant anti-BPH effects at equivalent doses of the raw H. plantaginea flower herb (1 and 4 g/kg), including reductions in prostate enlargement, wet weight, and prostatic index, along with improvements in damaged prostate tissue. Additionally, these fractions significantly increased testosterone levels and decreased dihydrotestosterone, 5α-reductase, and epidermal growth factor levels in prostate tissue. In addition, HPA and HPB fractions possess anti-BPH activities in vitro. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that HPA, HPB, and HPC reversed 33 differential metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism and the regulation of AMPK/JNK pathways, as well as their downstream STAT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB pathways.

In this study, we observed that MC-LR disrupted acrosome biogenesis, a critical process for sperm function. Mechanistically, MC-LR induced proteasomal degradation of Golgi-associated PDZ- and coiled-coil motif-containing protein (GOPC), a key acrosome assembly protein, by disrupting its ubiquitin homeostasis. This degradation resulted from dual inhibition of MC-LR on the deubiquitinase ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3). MC-LR directly bound to catalytic domain of UCHL3, obstructing its interaction with GOPC and inhibiting its enzymatic activity. MC-LR was also found to suppresses UCHL3 transcription and destabilizes UCHL3 protein stability. Further studies showed that UCHL3 dysfunction triggered excessive GOPC ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction. Our study provided the first mechanistic evidence linking an environmental toxin (MC-LR) to ubiquitination-dependent failure of spermiogenesis, specifically through GOPC degradation. We identified disruption of the UCHL3-GOPC regulatory axis as a novel etiological pathway in MC-LR-induced male infertility, highlighting this axis as a promising therapeutic target for chemical-induced reproductive dysfunction.",

Protein kinases evolved in eukaryotes as important mediators of cell signalling that target specific amino acid side chains to modulate downstream protein function. Among them, the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a family of intracellular protein kinases that form signalling cascades responding to a number of stimuli, that control fundamental mechanisms such as proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death. Signals propagate through consecutive kinases which eventually phosphorylate and activate a MAPK. Here, we show that the dual specificity threonine/tyrosine MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs) are able to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs using ADP as well as ATP in vitro. As the pathways are involved in the stress response, we speculate that it would represent an advantage to be able to maintain signalling under conditions such as hypoxia, that occur under a number of cell stresses, including cancer and atherosclerosis, where the available pool of ATP could be depleted.",

Currently, research on the ghrelin is primarily focused on a single species, and there have been no systematic studies on the evolution of the ghrelin in fish. Therefore, this thesis conducts a comprehensive analysis of the ghrelin gene in 151 species of ray-finned bony fishes to reveal the universality and specificity of the ghrelin gene in the evolutionary history of fish, supplementing and perfecting the information on the ghrelin gene in Actinopterygii. The gene identification results show that the number of ghrelin genes varies among different fish species, 41 fish have lost the ghrelin gene, 98 fish having one ghrelin gene, and 12 fish having two ghrelin genes. Among the 110 fish species with the ghrelin gene, a total of 182 ghrelin gene sequences were identified, with transcript variant numbers ranging from 1 to 6, encoding 1 to 3 types of isoform proteins, and their mature peptides show a certain degree of similarity across different species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that teleost ghrelin proteins segregate into three major evolutionary clades, with Salmoniformes orthologs comprising a distinct monophyletic cluster. The Cladistic and Chondrostei are clustered separately and then grouped with the more ancient Cypriniformes and Siluriformes species from the Neopterygii into a large group, while the other fish species from the Neopterygii form another large group. The Synteny analysis results indicate that the upstream gene of the ghrelin is CCDC174, and the downstream gene is TATDN2. The selection pressure analysis results show that there are no positive selection sites in the ghrelin gene, indicating that the ghrelin has been under strong functional constraint during the evolutionary process of fish. This study systematically investigates the evolutionary history of fish ghrelin, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the function and status of ghrelin in the feeding regulation system of fish, and deepening the recognition of its structural and functional evolution in the process of energy metabolism evolution.",

We therefore investigated the acute changes in amino acid metabolism during sepsis in a pig model. We studied 51 pigs using a pulse stable isotope tracer method to measure kinetic changes in almost all amino acids before and 6.5 h after sepsis induction by continuous infusion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Statistics were done by Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Sepsis induced only small (<10 %) changes in plasma concentration of amino acids, while amino acid clearance was substantially increased for amino acids like taurine (+33 %), histidine (+42 %), glycine (+35 %), glutamine (+27 %), arginine (+13 %) and citrulline (+20 %), while reduced for tyrosine (-11 %), threonine (-11 %), lysine (-14 %). Compartmental analysis revealed that changes in extra- and intracellular amino acid pools and fluxes were much larger than the changes in plasma concentrations. Intracellular pool sizes were substantially lower for glutamate (-47 %), lysine (-46 %), phenylalanine (-39 %), threonine (-33 %), and tyrosine (-28 %) and higher for taurine (+21 %), hydroxyproline (+31 %) and glutamine (+35 %). Notably, intracellular productions of essential amino acids like lysine (-49 %), phenylalanine (-25 %), threonine (-26 %), tryptophan (-22 %), and tyrosine (-22 %) were significantly reduced during sepsis, while those of taurine (+24 %) and glutamine (+34 %) were increased, suggesting attenuated protein breakdown in the early phase of sepsis. Plasma cytokine levels, including IL1-beta (+50 %), IL1-ra (+120 %), IL6 (+26 %), and TNF-alpha (+9 %), were also statistically significantly elevated. Large changes in intracellular amino acid metabolism occur relatively quickly during the development of sepsis, while changes in plasma concentration are small. Therefore, compartmental analysis of amino acid metabolism shows that changes in the extra- and intracellular pools and fluxes into these pools seems to precede the changes in plasma concentrations, indicating that amino acid metabolism is affected much more and sooner than could be concluded from measuring plasma concentrations only.",

Data as means [95%CI].\n\nThe study included 51 critically ill patients (age 63 yrs [58, 68], APACHEII 21.6 [20, 24]) and 49 matched healthy controls (age 57 yrs [52, 61]). While anthropometric characteristics were similar between critically ill patients and healthy adults, phase angle was lower (3.9 [3.5, 4.2] vs 6.0 [5.6, 6.3], p < 0.001), most AA blood levels were lower, while most cytokine levels were significantly higher. IL-6 and CRP were strongly associated (p < 0.001). IL-6 was the cytokine with the strongest association with the AA blood levels and WBP alterations in patients. Three patterns of changes in the plasma cytokine concentrations were observed. Of the 37 cytokines measured, 12 were higher in ICU patients, 5 were lower, and the rest were similar.\n\nThe present study shows a comprehensive picture of inflammation and simultaneous alterations of AA metabolism. The levels of IL-6 and CRP may become a good indicator of the metabolic capacity to respond positively to nutrition therapy.\n\nData are from the baseline measurements of study NCT02770092 (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02770092) and NCT03628365 (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03628365).",

Using a 3-factor, 5-level central composite design (CCD) within a response surface methodology (RSM) framework, 960 male broilers were randomly divided into 16 treatments, each comprising 6 replicates with 10 birds per replicate. The treatments included a control group (Con) fed a 19 % CP diet, and 15 dietary treatments with graded levels of dLys (0.97-1.23 %), dMet (0.43-0.53 %), and dThr (0.64-0.84 %). Results indicated that dLys had the strongest linear effect on body weight gain (BWG; P < 0.001). The optimal SID ratios were determined as dMet/dLys = 0.41 (0.468 %/1.145 %) and dThr/dLys = 0.64 (0.730 %/1.145 %) for BWG, and dMet/dLys = 0.38 (0.454 %/1.180 %) and dThr/dLys = 0.64 (0.757 %/1.180 %) for FCR. These optimizations enabled a 10.5 % reduction in dietary CP level without compromising growth performance, along with a 32.3 % decrease in nitrogen (N) excretion compared with the Con group. Furthermore, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of amino acids (AA) improved significantly compared with the Con group (P < 0.001). In summary, the findings suggest that precise AA balancing, with a priority on lysine (Lys) sufficiency, could sustain broiler productivity in low-protein systems while reducing feed costs and environmental footprint.",

    "combined_text": "HVT-delivered chicken IGF-1 improves growth performance in broilers.\n\nThe domesticated poultry is invaluable as a global protein source. Growth performance in poultry, particularly broilers, plays a critical role in production efficiency. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a multifunctional hormone which shows promotive effects on growth and development. Traditional IGF-1 delivery methods, such as injections or dietary supplements, face practical limitations including high cost, multiple dosages and rapid degradation. To explore a more efficient IGF-1 delivery method for promoting chicken growth, we generated a recombinant herpesvirus of turkey expressing chicken IGF-1, rHVT-chIGF-1. A single dose of rHVT-chIGF-1 was administered intramuscularly to broilers at day 1 of age. Growth performance parameters, including body weight (BW) and average daily weight gain (ADG) was assessed over a 42-day period. The results showed that, at both 35 and 42 days of age, the rHVT-IGF-1 group showed significantly higher BW and ADG compared to the HVT group (35d BW: p = 0.0063; 42d BW: p < 0.0001; 35d ADG: p < 0.0001; 42d ADG: p < 0.0001) and the blank control group (35d BW: p = 0.0189; 42d BW: p = 0.0032; 35d ADG: p < 0.0001; 42d ADG: p < 0.0001). The cross-sectional area (CSA) of pectoral and leg muscle fibres was significantly greater in chickens from the rHVT-chIGF-1 group compared to those in the HVT vector (p = 0.0078) and blank control (p = 0.025) groups. Additionally, the mRNA expression of muscle development-related genes was significantly upregulated in the rHVT-chIGF-1 group. These findings suggest that rHVT-chIGF-1 is a novel and effective in vivo delivery system for promoting chicken growth, offering an alternative to traditional IGF-1 delivery methods.",

In this study, differential anthocyanin accumulation in peel, outer flesh near the peel (OF) and inner flesh around the stone (IF) was observed in two peach fruit cultivars. This was driven by the expression of the R2R3 MYB transcription factor (TF) gene PpMYB10.1. Transcriptome and degradome sequencing were used to identify the regulatory network upstream of PpMYB10.1. We identified and functionally verified that NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) TFs PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 are activators of anthocyanin accumulation. Protein-protein/DNA interaction assays were conducted, and it was observed that both PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 could form homodimers to directly activate the PpMYB10.1 promoter. Degradome analysis showed cleavage of PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 transcripts occurred via miR164a. Compared with peel and OF, a lower expression of miR164a in IF resulted in higher expression of PpNAC22 and PpNAC100. Functional characterisation showed that overexpression of miR164a significantly reduced anthocyanin accumulation driven by PpNAC22 and PpNAC100. Furthermore, another NAC TF, PpNAC29, was identified to be indirectly involved in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation. PpNAC29 formed a heterodimer with PpNAC22, although it could not bind to the PpMYB10.1 promoter. PpNAC29 transcription could be activated by PpNAC22 and PpNAC100 and the transcript was not targeted by miR164a, revealing a miR164a-PpNAC22/100-PpNAC29 cascade. This miR164a-PpNAC22/100-PpMYB10.1 module, with the assistance of PpNAC29, explains contrasting anthocyanin accumulation in different fruit tissues of peach.",

Traditional methods rely on Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks and limited biological feature data, often neglecting the critical role of protein amino acid sequences. To address this, we propose the HCNS model, which integrates the Hypergraph Convolutional Network (HGCN) module, the Seq-CNN-MB-NAG feature extraction module, and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) recognition module, significantly enhancing the accuracy of essential protein identification. The HGCN module constructs a hypergraph from the PPI network and protein complex data, capturing the complex structural relationships between proteins. The Seq-CNN-MB-NAG module utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and NAG Transformer to process protein amino acid sequences and extract sequence features. The MLP module then fuses these two sets of features for precise recognition. Experimental results show that the HCNS model outperforms existing methods, achieving an accuracy of 93.38%, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.33% and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR) of 97.16%, demonstrating its potential in essential protein identification.",

To address this, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the potential response mechanisms in tilapia subjected to both factors. Tilapia were fed normal (NC) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 90 days, then challenged with S. agalactiae. At 48 h post-infection, blood, liver, and spleen samples were collected for biochemical parameter analysis and gene expression profiling. The results indicated that the combined treatment upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (pparα) and fatty acid transport protein 1 (fatp1). Concurrently, it increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (hmgcr) expression, while decreasing cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (cyp7a1) expression compared to HFD alone. Antioxidant status analysis revealed that the combined treatment decreased glutathione (GSH) content, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (nqo1), and glutathione peroxidase 3 (gpx3).

Moreover, all experimental groups showed elevated expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (ire1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (eif2ak3), activating transcription factor 6 (atf6), and binding immunoglobulin protein (bip). These findings collectively demonstrated that HFD exacerbated the pathogenic effects of S. agalactiae through multiple mechanisms, including metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress potentiation, and complex immunomodulation.

However, gastrointestinal digestion can induce structural rearrangements of their IgE-binding epitopes, complicating the precise evaluation of allergenicity. This study developed a novel approach to identify digestion-resistant antigenic epitopes of BLG and ALA through simulated in vitro infant digestion. A peptidomics approach based on mass spectrometry, combined with high-throughput molecular docking, was employed to predict peptide interactions with the IgE fragment of antigen binding. Seven antigenic epitopes and 22 key amino acids were identified from BLG-derived peptides, and five antigenic epitopes and 18 key amino acids were identified from ALA-derived peptides. The allergenicity of synthetic epitopes ranged from 40 % to 80 %, and the dissociation constant between epitopes and IgE ranged from 17.90 nM to 279.01 nM, confirming their strong IgE-binding potential. Notably, this synergistic integration of computational prediction and experimental validation establishes a paradigm for characterizing digestion-resistant antigenic epitopes.",

The results showed that SMF-LIF technology significantly reduced freezing damage by synergistically regulating ice crystal growth kinetics (69 μm, compared to 205 μm in the RF group) and intermolecular interactions, resulting in lower centrifugal loss (12.92 %), higher hardness (1280.01 g), and better preservation of muscle microstructure integrity. The magnetic field induces the alignment of water molecule dipoles, which helps stabilize protein structures by maintaining the key hydrogen bond network in the head region of myosin, maintaining a high α-helix content, and reducing the formation of random coils. The results demonstrated that SMF-LIF, as an innovative physical intervention technique, could improve the quality of frozen seafood products and holds great potential for industrial application.",

With an average egg production of 40 eggs per season and yielding 58.59% carcass on live weight, ostriches offer substantial economic benefits. The nutritional needs of ostriches evolve across different life stages, impacting growth and reproductive performance. As herbivores capable of digesting high-fiber diets, ostriches thrive on roughage and pasture, with a digestive system similar to other poultry. Essential nutrients, including 20-24% crude protein (CP) and 12-19% crude fiber, are critical for optimal development, particularly in early growth, where their feed conversion ratio is 2:1. As ostriches reach sexual maturity, maintaining a diet rich in amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrates becomes vital for optimizing fertility and reproductive performance. This review provides a detailed overview of ostrich nutrient requirements across different growth stages, focusing on how energy and protein levels affect overall growth and productivity. It also explores the importance of feeding management practices in enhancing ostrich health and performance, offering insights for improving commercial ostrich farming.",

Six hundred Cobb500 day-old-chicks were allocated to five dietary treatments: Standard broiler diet, with no inclusion of AGPs (NegControl); Standard broiler diet, with inclusion of AGPs (PosControl); Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % probiotics (Prob); Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % stimbiotics (Stim) and Standard broiler diet + 0.01 % probiotics and 0.01 % stimbiotics) (ProbStim). Each dietary treatment was replicated 8 times, with a pen holding 15 birds as the experimental unit. The experimental trial was conducted over three feeding phases: starter phase (day 1- 14), grower phase (day 15- 28) and finisher phase (day 29- 42). The birds were subjected to heat stress in the grower phase and finisher phase for 3 h (11:00- 14:00 h). Diet had no effect on ADFI in the starter, grower and finisher phase. Similarly, diet had no effect on ADG and FCR in both grower and finisher phase. The cumulative weight gain was consistently low in broiler chickens fed the Stim diet throughout the feeding phases, while those fed Prob diet had higher weights in week 2 and to 6. Dietary treatments did not affect protein consumed, protein efficiency ratio, specific growth rate and growth efficiency across all the feeding phases. Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were significantly affected by diet (P < 0.05) with broiler chickens fed PosControl in non- stressed environment having the highest total cholesterol (3.90± 0.18) and triglyceride level (1.77± 0.12). With regards to behavioral response to heat stress induced discomfort, broilers fed PosControl (2.33±0.26) and Prob (2.33±0.26) exhibited increased pecking feed activity and increased tendencies of seeking cooler areas. Overall, the birds did not show signs of severe stress. In conclusion, Probiotics and Stimbiotics could be used in combination to replace of AGPs without negatively affecting productivity in broilers.",

Exposure to high concentrations of ABA during seed germination resulted in the identification of 23 putative mutant lines, which were re-evaluated to select those with the strongest ABA-insensitive phenotype. Whole-genome resequencing of ABA-sensitive and -insensitive plants of the selected mutant line 2087 revealed a G > A transition in a gene encoding the phosphatase 2C protein clade H CpPP2C-H1A as responsible for the ABA-insensitive phenotype. The so-called pp2c-h1a mutation resulted in the substitution of E345K in a conserved amino acid within a conserved motif of plant PP2Cs. The mutation did not alter the germination rate in water, but favored germination in the presence of ABA. The pp2c-h1a mutation increased water loss under various stress conditions, while increasing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and preventing stomatal closure in response to external ABA treatments. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR revealed that the transcripts of CpPP2C-H1A and its paralog CpPP2C-H1B accumulated similarly in all tissues analyzed. The transcription of both genes was not altered by the pp2c-h1a mutation. The transcription of CpPP2C-H1A did not change in response to treatments with ABA, cold, PEG, and NaCl in seedling leaves, and that of CpPP2C-H1B changed only in response to cold. However, the expression of both genes was up-regulated in seeds after imbibition and germination and was significantly induced by NaCl treatment in germinated seeds. Taken together, these data indicate that CpPP2C-H1A acts as a negative regulator of ABA signaling in germination inhibition and stomatal closure under adverse conditions.",

    "combined_text": "Deciphering autophagy signaling in cancer: A paradigm shift from molecular classifications to clinical innovations.\n\nThe intracellular breakdown process known as autophagy occurs when cells experience adverse conditions, such as organelle damage, the presence of abnormal proteins, hypoxia stress, low energy levels, or nutritional deprivation. The autophagic process begins by forming autophagosomes, which then merge with lysosomes to recycle degraded materials. Autophagy functions in multiple ways to affect cancer development and treatment outcomes. Tumor cells with low autophagy levels may exhibit anti-tumor effects during cancer initiation because their connection to malignant transformation is possible. The promotion of autophagy appears beneficial for cancer prevention in this context. The survival of cancer cells through increased autophagy enables tumor growth in existing tumors by allowing them to overcome metabolic and treatment-related challenges. Research indicates that blocking autophagy through the use of drugs or genetic methods makes cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies, suggesting that inhibiting the autophagic system may be a promising approach to enhance treatment. Excessive autophagy activation could be a therapeutic approach to manage cancer cells that resist cell death. The successful treatment of cancer requires an understanding of autophagy's dual nature. This review examines potential therapeutic strategies for tumors by analyzing autophagy-related signaling pathways and the essential factors that influence cancer development.",

Here, we present a multi-tiered systems biology framework to investigate the anti-metastatic potential of enterolactone (EL), integrating computational, transcriptomic, and experimental approaches in the MDA-MB-231 TNBC model. Network pharmacology identified 78 EL-metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) overlapping targets as potential therapeutic targets of EL against mTNBC, with PPI and GMFA network enrichment uncovering key metastasis-associated pathways including Notch, TGF-β, TNF, and ErbB signaling. Molecular docking and 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations revealed stable binding of EL to several core oncogenic proteins (e.g., EGFR, PARP1, AURKB, SMAD4, CDK4), suggesting poly-pharmacological engagement. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of EL-treated cells coupled with GSEA revealed coordinated downregulation of oncogenic programs including E2F, G2/M checkpoint, MYC targets, EMT, and metabolic plasticity, alongside induction of NRF2 signaling and ferroptosis. This study reports, for the first time, transcriptome-wide effects of EL in MDA-MB-231 cells, linking its activity to the repression of stemness, invasion, and immune-evasive traits. Experimental validation via qPCR confirmed EL-mediated suppression of key molecular targets of TGF-β and Notch signaling pathways. EL also impaired cortactin expression and disrupted cytoskeletal remodeling, validated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry studies, indicating attenuation of invasive machinery. Furthermore, EL reduced metastatic dissemination in a zebrafish xenograft model, reinforcing its in vivo anti-metastatic potential. Together, our integrative study elucidates EL's multitarget mechanism against metastatic TNBC and highlights its translational promise as a systems-level modulator of oncogenic signaling. These findings warrant further in-depth mechanistic investigations to validate EL's therapeutic potential.",

    "combined_text": "Lonicerae flos and turmeric extracts alleviate necrotic enteritis in broilers by modulating gut-liver health and microbiota.\n\nNecrotic enteritis (NE) can cause intestinal barrier dysfunction in broilers, leading to secondary liver injury (SLI). In this process, the gut-liver axis plays a crucial role. Lonicerae flos and turmeric extracts (LTE), containing chlorogenic acid and curcumin, have been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Based on these potential biological benefits, this study aims to investigate the reparative effects of LTE on the intestinal barrier dysfunction in NE-infected broilers and assess its therapeutic efficacy in alleviating SLI. By elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of LTE on gut-liver axis health, this research provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of NE in broilers.\n\nLTE improved body weight and average daily gain while reducing intestinal lesion scores, coccidia oocysts, and Clostridium perfringens counts in NE broilers (P < 0.05). LTE enhanced intestinal morphology and up-regulated the expression of tight junction protein genes (CLDN1, TJP1) and MUC2, suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, and minimized endotoxin (ET) accumulation in NE broilers (P < 0.05). Furthermore, LTE alleviated oxidative stress in ileal cells and protected mitochondrial structure and function in NE broilers. NE infection induced intestinal permeability in broilers, leading to increased serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and intestinal-derived endotoxin levels, which caused liver damage. LTE significantly reduced liver pathologic damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, and ROS levels in NE broilers (P < 0.05). Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that NE significantly increased the relative abundance of Barnesiella and decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroidota, Desulfobacterota and Bacteroides in the cecum of broilers. LTE enhanced intestinal microbiota diversity and reduced the segregation of intestinal microbiota induced by NE infection.\n\nIn summary, LTE can alleviate NE and SLI by modulating the microbiota, inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress, and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby enhancing gut-liver axis health and growth performance.",

    "combined_text": "The EAT-Lancet diet in relation nutrient intake among older adults: insights from the Gothenburg H70 birth cohort study.\n\nThe EAT-Lancet Commission has proposed a global reference diet aimed at promoting both human health and environmental sustainability. While adherence to this dietary pattern has been associated with reduced risks of chronic disease and lower environmental impact, concerns remain about its ability to meet nutritional requirements - particularly among older adults. The aim was to explore the association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and nutrient intake and adequacy among 70-year-old adults in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nThis cross-sectional study included 861 participants from the Swedish population-based Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study (mean age 70.5 years, 55% women). Dietary intake was assessed using a validated diet history interview, and adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was scored based on 14 food components. Nutrient intake was evaluated against age- and sex-specific recommended intake (RI) levels. Cardiometabolic risk markers and biomarkers of nutritional status, including homocysteine and haemoglobin, were measured. Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine trends across sex-specific tertiles of diet adherence, with sensitivity analyses adjusting for energy intake and comparing adequacy based on average requirement (AR) thresholds.\n\nHigher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was linked to higher intake of fibre and polyunsaturated fats, and lower intake of saturated fat and alcohol. Mean protein intake per kilogram body weight/day was similar across adherence tertiles. Intake of beta-carotene, folate, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and iron was higher with greater adherence, while retinol equivalents, vitamin B12, niacin equivalents was lower- patterns that remained consistent after energy adjustment. Despite lower B12 intake, homocysteine levels were lowest in the group with highest adherence, and anaemia prevalence did not differ. Micronutrient adequacy improved with higher adherence for vitamin E, folate, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and iron. Similar results were observed using average requirement (AR) thresholds in sensitivity analyses.\n\nAdherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was associated with a more favourable nutrient profile in this cohort of older adults, without evidence of widespread micronutrient inadequacy. These findings suggest that environmentally sustainable diets can support adequate nutrition when well-balanced, even in nutritionally vulnerable populations such as older adults.",

    "combined_text": "Coptisine alleviates high glucose-induced HUVEC dysfunction in vitro and inhibits gestational diabetes mellitus in vivo.\n\nThe dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) is an important cause of diabetes-related cardiovascular diseases. Coptisine is a bioactive component of Rhizoma coptidis with anti-diabetes property. The aim of this present study was to clarify the role and possible mechanism of coptisine underlying VEC dysfunction during gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with coptisine and/or high glucose (HG) medium. A GDM rat model was established by high-fat diet feeding and streptozotocin injection. Cell viability, migration, and angiogenesis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, wound healing assay, Transwell assay, and tube formation assay. The levels of angiogenesis-related proteins and the key markers in the Adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK)/nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway were tested by western blot analysis. The pathological changes of placental tissues were observed by HE staining. We found that the cell viability of HUVECs was repressed in HG conditions in a dose-dependent manner, and 25 mM HG reduced the HUVEC viability in a time-dependent manner. Coptisine (5 to 5o μM) did not cause cytotoxicity to HUVECs. In addition, HG-induced the decrease in cell viability and migration of HUVECs were rescued by coptisine in a dose-dependent manner. Coptisine restored the angiogenetic ability of HG-induced HUVECs by upregulating the protein expression of fibroblast growth factor 2, vascular endothelial-derived growth factor, and Angiotensin 1. Moreover, coptisine treatment re-activated the AMPK/NRF2 pathway in HG-stimulated HUVECs. Importantly, inhibition of AMPK/NRF2 signaling reverses the effect of coptisine on cell viability, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs. The in vivo study demonstrated that coptisine suppresses hyperglycemia and placenta injury in GDM rats. Coptisine protected HUVECs from hyperglycemic insult, suggesting the potential of coptisine which might be used as a therapeutic agent for VEC dysfunction in GDM.",

Rye flour contains high levels of phytase that will be activated during the soaking process. ... Even without the rye flour, overnight soaking of oats and other low-phytase grains greatly improves digestibility but won’t eliminate too much phytic acid. ...

      "“The calories from protein are derived from its amino acids, which can be used to build muscle, enzymes, and other tissues, effectively “storing” those calories in the chemical bonds of new tissue rather than burning them for immediate energy. However, the process of digesting protein (thermic effect, 20-30% of calories burned) and building tissues (e.g., muscle protein synthesis) consumes additional energy, often drawn from fat stores or other sources in a calorie deficit. Thus, while protein contributes to your total caloric intake, its calories are often partitioned toward structural roles, making it less efficient as an energy source compared to carbs or fats, especially when prioritizing muscle preservation or growth.”\n\n***\n\nSo while protein is 4 calories per gram, after digestion, it’s more around 3 calories per gram",
      "Your TDEE should take that into account via basal metabolic rate / neat + eat (more active people need more calories partly because of the increased muscle protein synthesis).\n\nHowever, there’s an interesting recent study that shows that in resistance trained individuals, significantly overeating protein doesn’t lead to a change in body composition: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5786199/",
      "I don’t think our bodies are systematic like that since protein always comes with fat in nature. How our bodies are is more complicated and interconnected than how we break it down to explain and understand things in isolation or/and categories. \n\nThere are different protein recommendations based on your goals.

      "When amino acids are broken down and consumed as energy, they are no longer available to be used in protein synthesis for building & repair — the proverbial eating ur cake & having it too.  The ironic part of this equation is that the body requires energy to catalyze the protein digestion process and that energy must come in from outside the reaction itself, thus why most animal protein is wrapped in fat or other high-energy sourced materials.",
      "Basically, your body uses protein both for energy and for building/repairing tissue. The calories used for building aren’t “lost,” they’re just redirected to muscle and other functions, so you don’t necessarily need extra calories beyond your TDEE. Tracking total calories is usually enough, but thinking about how protein is used can help if you’re focused on maintaining muscle while cutting fat."

    "combined_text": "Title: How do the calories from protein work?\n\nPost: Hi everyone, this may be an extremely stupid question but I can’t find the answer I’m looking for so I wanted to ask here in hopes one of you could clear up some of my misconceptions.\n\nEdit: TLDR: If you eat 800 calories of protein and 50% (random percent) are used for energy and 50% are used for building, then won’t you your body need an additional 400 calories to maintain its TDEE? (Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!\n\nComments:\n#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  \n\nDiscussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than \"cuz I sed\" or entertainment pieces.

Magnesium citrate, for example, contains only 11% elemental magnesium. And only 30% of this is absorbed.”\n\nOn the web, you’ll see many sites claiming that only 4% of the magnesium in magnesium oxide is absorbed. This claim is based upon a small study by Firoz et al. (2001), which is discussed fully below. The actual data in this study shows something very different. The stated percentage of elemental magnesium absorbed from magnesium oxide in the above table — 23% — is the statistic provided in a review and meta-analysis of numerous studies by Ranade et al., (2001), cited below.\n\nIn a study involving 18 men, 24 hours after consumption of magnesium oxide supplements, magnesium levels in the urine increased about two times the normal amount. And, after 48 hours, magnesium levels had increased to roughly four times normal. The conclusion drawn by the researchers: these results clearly show that “magnesium oxide is effectively absorbed and elevates the biologically-active levels of magnesium in the bloodstream.”\n\nIn one such study in 2005, rats were first given a magnesium-depleted diet and then provided with the same diet supplemented with 10 different magnesium salts: magnesium oxide, chloride, sulfate, carbonate, acetate, picolate, citrate, gluconate, lactate or aspartate. The results showed that while magnesium absorption values varied from 50% to 67%, all the magnesium salts used were equally efficient in restoring magnesium levels.\n\nThe researchers also noted that “the quantity of magnesium in the digestive tract is the major factor controlling the amount of magnesium absorbed.” And as you now know, magnesium oxide contains a far greater amount of elemental magnesium than any of the other magnesium salts.\n\nThe addition of phytic acid to the animals’ diet is important because phytic acid binds strongly to minerals and forms an insoluble complex. This means less of the minerals consumed can be absorbed. Despite the addition of phytic acid to the animals’ diet, all the magnesium salts tested were found to be comparably bioavailable: “The results indicate that any differences in the magnesium bioavailability of the compounds were small and physiologically irrelevant.”\n\nThe lower parts of the small intestine are the primary sites of magnesium absorption. However, magnesium is also absorbed throughout the entire intestinal tract. Magnesium does not have special carriers that pull it into the bloodstream. Its absorption is a passive transcellular process.\n\nFor this kind of absorption process, the quantity of magnesium that passes through the digestive tract is the major factor controlling the amount of magnesium that is absorbed.\n\nBecause magnesium oxide contains more elemental magnesium and is less soluble, it’s absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly as it passes through the digestive tract. It will not raise blood levels excessively, and will therefore not be rapidly excreted.",

      "MagOxid is extremely well absorbed. Bad rep comes from old/bad studies and the urban legends that follows and never stops. Old studies showed less magnesium in serum than other forms while turns out oxide actually stays in cells much more than other forms.

Its absorption is a passive transcellular process.\n\nFor this kind of absorption process, the quantity of magnesium that passes through the digestive tract is the major factor controlling the amount of magnesium that is absorbed.\n\nBecause magnesium oxide contains more elemental magnesium and is less soluble, it’s absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly as it passes through the digestive tract. It will not raise blood levels excessively, and will therefore not be rapidly excreted.\n\nMagnesium oxide, as well as citrate, has a laxative effect on most people. I believe that is the main reason people avoid them.\n\nMagOxid is extremely well absorbed. Bad rep comes from old/bad studies and the urban legends that follows and never stops. Old studies showed less magnesium in serum than other forms while turns out oxide actually stays in cells much more than other forms. Check some new doctors who says oxide is just as good as any other forms. Actually best doctors say to take many different forms of magnesium including oxide\n\nRules of r/supplements \n\n1.\nDo Not Suggest Prescription Drugs\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Do Not Suggest Prescription Drugs\nPrescription drugs are not Supplements; do not recommend prescription medication. \nSensible/Suggest talking to DR. can be allowable etc\n                  \n\n2.\nDangerous Grey Area Substance\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Dangerous Grey Area Substance\nPotentially dangerous grey area substances can not be recommended.\n\n\n3.\nBe Polite\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Rude/Personal Attacks\nYou shouldn't ever be personally attacking another user in this subreddit.\n\n\n4.\nNo Advertisements\nPosts & Comments\nReported as: Advertisement.

Thanks!\n\ntry malate\n\nThe dosage is adjusted with respect to Its absorption rate in most supplements, and it's better to take it with food to maximize it. \n\nPersonally, magnesium is not one of those things where pricier necessarily means better. (Unlike Lion's Mane, different topic).\n\nI like citrate most. But some people will prefer oxide or even chloride, which barely ever gets any mention."

I'm not sure if you're aware of the % DV reflecting protein adjusted for PDCAAS scores, but I just found out that one of the protein powders I use - sunwarrior brown rice - only lists 16% DV per 20g when it should be 40%?! \n\nPlus warrior blend shows only 25% per 17g protein when it should be 34%?! \n\nThis is the case for many plant proteins !! I've yet to find one that match the actual DV :(\n\nI am very baffled and overthinking - did I waste my money ? SW claims complete proteins, but it is not reflected in the DV ?\n\nI thought I'd been getting 90-100g protein per day, but it might be 60-70g in actuality ? \n\nMakes sense given my serum protein markers have been falling lately, ever since I switched to SW brown rice from pea (in an attempt to reduce iron - I have high ferritin) :(. \n\nDo you guys track these?

Does it matter whether they are \"complete\" if I get sufficient protein / varied sources throughout the day ?\n\nGahh really stressing. \n\nComments:\nIt’s literally noise that doesn’t matter at all if eating a varied diet.

Fruit juice and gatorade during and around your basketball sessions will also help with a caloric surplus, which will help you grow.\n\nEdit: look into organic fruit juices if possible. I like pure orange juice"

LAB strains resistant to cadmium were screened using MRS broth supplemented with cadmium at an initial concentration of 30 mg/L. Out of 50 isolates tested, ten were selected based on their strong growth in the presence of cadmium and their ability to form biofilms. These isolates were identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolate N4, identified as Levilactobacillus brevis, exhibited the highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for cadmium at 600 mg/L and showed effective cadmium removal after 72 h, achieving a removal rate of 36.94% and a cadmium uptake (qe) of 35.415 mg/g. Proteomic analysis of N4 using LC-MS Triple TOF chromatography revealed 1094 proteins. Among these, 65 were unique to the control group, 655 were unique to the cadmium-treated group, and 294 were shared. The differentially abundant proteins were primarily involved in energy metabolism, cell wall synthesis, amino acid and lipid metabolism, and substance transport. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which Levilactobacillus brevis binds and removes cadmium, supporting its potential application in mitigating heavy metal pollution.",

Proteases produced by halophiles showed exceptional efficiency in breaking down the complex structures ranging from pigments to extracellular proteins, tissue proteins to tumors, and thrombin clots. There is a huge global demand for naturally occurring thrombolytic proteases to treat intravascular thrombosis, as they are cost-effective and have minimal detrimental effects, making them widely used in the biomedical applications.\n\nThe production of thrombolytic protease from the rare halophile Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum strain M4 and its in-vitro thrombolytic activity is investigated for the first time. On skim milk agar, a distinct zone of casein hydrolysis was observed, in submerged fermentation a substantial protease production was noted. The enzyme was purified through a four-step purification process following an initial precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate, subsequent ion-exchange chromatography using DEAE-cellulose, and final gel-filtration chromatography utilizing Sephadex G-100. As a result, a protein with a specific activity of 300 ± 32 U/mg was obtained with a purification fold of 19 and a recovery percentage of 38.2%. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 14.4 kDa via SDS-PAGE while MALDI/MS analysis further revealed a 131 amino acid sequence with an isoelectric point of 8.55 and on comparison, the strain M4 alkaline protease aligns with the proteasome subunit alpha. The protease is classified as a serine protease based on the inhibition by PMSF and its activity profile. The in-vitro thrombolytic assay revealed that the purified enzyme achieved a clot lysis rate of 65 ± 3%, performing effectively in comparison to the standard.\n\nThe findings indicate that strain M4 is an efficient producer of thrombolytic protease and the purified form effectively dissolves thrombin clots. Currently, the studies are underway to explore its potential for biomedical applications and industrial-scale production.",

    "combined_text": "Proteomic pathways across the ejection fraction spectrum in patients with heart failure and diabetes mellitus: an EXSCEL trial substudy.\n\nEjection fraction (EF) is a key component of heart failure (HF) classification. However, the biologic basis of HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF) as a distinct biologic entity distinct from HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) and reduced EF (HFrEF) has not been well characterized. The EXSCEL trial randomized participants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) exenatide (EQW) vs. placebo. For this study, profiling of ~ 5000 proteins using the SomaLogic SomaScan platform was performed in baseline and 12-month serum samples from N = 1199 participants with prevalent HF at baseline. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA (FDR p < 0.1) were used to identify proteins that were significantly between three EF groups (EF > 55% [HFpEF], EF 40-55% [HFmrEF], EF < 40% [HFrEF], categories as previously curated in the parent trial). Cox proportional hazards was used to assess association between baseline levels of proteins significantly different between groups, and changes in protein level between baseline and 12-month, with time-to-HF hospitalization. Mixed models were used to assess whether significant proteins changed differentially with exenatide vs. placebo therapy. Of N = 1199 EXSCEL participants with prevalent HF, 284 (24%), 704 (59%) and 211 (18%) had HFpEF, HFmrEF and HFrEF, respectively. Eight principal components analysis (PCA) protein factors differed significantly across the three EF groups, of which 270 individual proteins within those factors were significant. The majority of proteins (75%) demonstrated similar levels in HFmrEF and HFpEF with higher levels in HFrEF. Biologic pathways of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, ECM receptor interaction (tenascin C [TNC], COL28A1), complement and coagulation cascades, and epithelial apical surface and junctions demonstrated enrichment among proteins with this dominant pattern. A minority of proteins (1%) demonstrated similar levels between HFmrEF and HFrEF with lower levels in HFpEF, including MMP-9 (p < 0.0001). Baseline levels of the majority of the 270 proteins (92%) were also associated with time-to-incident HF hospitalization including domains of extracellular matrix (COL28A1, TNC), angiogenesis (VEGFa, VEGFd), myocyte stretch (NT-proBNP), and renal function (cystatin-C). Change in levels of 8% of these from baseline to 12 months (including increase in TNC) predicted incident HF hospitalization (p < 0.05). Levels of 41% of the 270 significant proteins (including TNC and NT-proBNP; p < 0.0001) were reduced differentially by EQW compared with placebo. In conclusion, we found that serum levels of the vast majority of proteins across multiple biologic domains were similar between HFmrEF and HFpEF suggesting that HFmrEF may be more biologically similar to HFpEF than HFrEF. We also identified specific biomarkers showing this pattern, most notably TNC, for which baseline and change levels predicted incident HF hospitalization and were beneficially modified by the GLP-1 RA EQW. These results may offer unique data on prognosis and pharmacotherapy modification with variability by EF.",

Depending on the surrounding microenvironment, macrophages polarize into a wide spectrum of immunophenotypes with 2 extreme opposite ends-proinflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2. Elucidating the biochemical bases of distinct macrophage immunophenotypes, as well as discriminating between these phenotypes, are paramount to understanding the contributions of macrophage subpopulations to health and diseases. In this study, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were treated with LPS or IL-4 to induce the M1/M(LPS) or M2/M(IL-4) state, respectively. Comparative proteomic analyses demonstrate that M1 and M2 macrophages have their own unique protein landscapes. The signature proteins of M1 and M2 macrophages are engaged in distinct signaling pathways, which offer the biochemical bases for their specialized functions. The plasma membrane proteins Clec4e and Cd72 are identified as new biomarkers to discriminate murine M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively. Comparison of the proteomes of murine and human macrophages leads to identification of 2 new shared M1 biomarkers, Gbp2/GBP2 and Acod1/ACOD1. In addition, CLEC4E is validated as a new M1 biomarker for human primary macrophages. This study provides an unbiased protein dataset of murine primary M1/M(LPS) and M2/M(IL-4) macrophages for future research in macrophage biology. The plasma membrane localization of the new biomarkers Clec4e and Cd72 facilitates their labeling and detection. The new M1 biomarkers shared by human and mouse primary macrophages have potential broad applications in both basic research and clinical practice.",

Protein intake is crucial for maintaining muscle mass and strength. However, older adults typically consume less protein compared to younger individuals. It has recently been shown that the time of the first refrigerator opening in the morning, indicated by a door sensor, may be correlated with frailty in older individuals living alone.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine whether the time of the first refrigerator opening in the morning can serve as a potential indicator of protein intake in older patients (age ≥70 years) after hospitalization for HF decompensation over a period of 6 months.\n\nThis is a substudy of a prospective interventional cohort study that aims to identify changes in digital biomarkers derived from an ambient sensor system, which may support the early detection of HF decompensation. In this substudy, the frequency and timing of refrigerator door openings in participants' homes will be measured. To assess associations between protein intake and refrigerator openings, dietary intake will be evaluated using 24-hour dietary recalls at 3 different timepoints: at 1, 3, and 6 months after hospital discharge. All 24-hour dietary recalls will be conducted by trained dietitians in face-to-face interviews on weekdays. The primary outcome of this study will be the correlation between protein intake and the time (in minutes after midnight) of the first refrigerator door opening at each of the 3 assessment points.\n\nThe study is currently in the data collection phase. Recruitment began in February 2024. Data analysis will begin after all data have been collected. As of manuscript submission, 12 patients have been recruited. Results are expected to be published by the end of 2025.\n\nConsidering that protein-rich foods are typically stored in the refrigerator, the relationship between frailty and refrigerator usage may be a relevant indicator for nutritional assessment, particularly regarding protein intake. In addition, sarcopenia and frailty may also be linked to protein distribution across meals. This study will explore whether monitoring refrigerator openings can serve as a simple method for identifying increased risk of frailty and sarcopenia. Early detection through such monitoring could facilitate timely interventions and potentially reduce the risk of these conditions.\n\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT06126848; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06126848.\n\nDERR1-10.2196/66299.",

In the subgroup analysis, a significant association between PPN level and MGUS was mainly found in the overall population, female sex, non-Hispanic black, non-hypercholesterolemia, non-type 2 diabetes (T2D), high school education or above, and divorced or widowed; however, there was no significant interaction between PPN level and MGUS in each subgroup.\n\nPPN levels were significantly associated with MGUS development. Our study identified PPN as a novel and convenient inflammatory marker with potential clinical relevance. Although preliminary, the observed associations highlight the need for validation through longitudinal studies before considering their clinical applications.",

    "combined_text": "A Slower-Progressing TDP-43 rNLS8 Mouse Model for ALS: Implications for Preclinical and Mechanistic Studies.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by motor neuron degeneration, muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventual death, with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology observed in almost all cases. Mouse models based on TDP-43 are thus essential for studying ALS and developing therapeutic approaches. The TDP-43 rNLS8 mouse model expresses a human TDP-43 transgene with a mutated nuclear localization sequence (hTDP-43 ΔNLS), but this is normally suppressed by the presence of doxycycline (Dox). Disease is initiated by removal of Dox, which replicates key ALS features, including TDP-43 pathology, neuromuscular junction denervation, motor neuron loss, and reduced survival. However, this model has a rapid disease progression which limits its use for extended preclinical studies and investigation of early disease mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we explored whether maintaining low Dox concentrations in the diet (10-20 mg/kg) could slow disease progression. Our findings demonstrate that this approach significantly reduced hTDP-43 ΔNLS expression (up to 4.8-fold), which delayed disease onset by four weeks. Disease progression, assessed by rotarod performance, grip strength, and neurological scores, was extended from six to 15 weeks, with a threefold increase in survival. Despite slower progression, at the end stage, mice displayed similar levels of neuroinflammation, motor neuron loss, as Dox off mice. These findings highlight slower-progressing TDP-43 rNLS8 mice as a robust model for preclinical and early disease mechanism studies.",

While efficient in promoting bile acid (BA) detoxification and limiting liver fibrosis, its clinical use is restricted by severe dose-dependent side effects. We tested the hypothesis that adding n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids to OCA may improve the therapeutic effect of the low drug dosage. Several liver cell lines were exposed to vehicle, low or high OCA dose (1-20 μM) in the presence or absence of EPA/DHA for 24 h. To induce ER stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis, HepG2 cells were exposed to a 400 μM BA mixture or to 2 ng/ml transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). For inflammation analyses, THP-1 cells were activated with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The impact of OCA+EPA/DHA was assessed using transcriptomic (qRT-PCR), proteomic (ELISA, caspase-3), and metabolomic (LC-MS/MS) approaches. The addition of EPA/DHA reinforced the ability of low OCA dose to down-regulate the expression of genes involved in BA synthesis (CYP7A1 and CYP8B1) and uptake (NTCP) and to up-regulate the expression of MRP2 and 3 genes. EPA/DHA also enhanced the anti-inflammatory response of the drug by reducing the expression of the LPS-induced cytokines: tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in THP-1 macrophages. OCA+EPA/DHA decreased the expression of BIP, CHOP, and COL1A1 genes and the caspase-3 activity. EPA+DHA potentiate the response to low OCA doses on BA toxicity and provide additional benefits on ER stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. These observations support the idea that adding n-3 PUFAs to the drug may reduce the risk of dose-related side effects in patients treated with OCA.",

I didn’t expect much — maybe slightly better sleep or something like that. I have tried multi vitamins, and several fitness supplements, and 99% of the time I don’t really feel any difference, and have thought most supplements to be a waste of money and time.\n\nAnyone have better experience with specific supplement brands, or specific magnesium types?\n\nHere is what I experienced:\n\nOn the positive side\n\n* Woke up feeling… clearer in the morning (perhaps due to better sleep)\n* Felt calmer during day and evening, not wired like usual after work.\n* Sneaky bonus: fewer tension headaches (not a miracle—but noticeable, been having regular migraines for past 10 years, so any period without is amazing)\n\nNegative side:\n\n* Stomach cramps in the morning 3 of the days in the week I tried it. Don’t know if it has been due to the magnesium tablets I bought.\n\nThe supplement I tried: easy to find, inexpensive, and backed by some interesting studies on stress, sleep, and nervous system support.\n\nCurious—has anyone else tried magnesium? What form did you use, and what did it do for you? Would love honest experiences 🤔\n\nAs something new, I am trying to share my experiences with everything I try on YouTube, as perhaps a better format than articles. I am not very good at it, but perhaps its a good way to communicate stuff like this.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdFNQ6dQ2wU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdFNQ6dQ2wU)\n\n\n\nComments:\nI find it really really hard to get up in the morning after taking magnesium.\n\nYou took the wrong magnesium for sleep.

Identification of multiple metalloproteins from native expression (\"metalloproteomics\") based on a single chromatography has low resolution and/or sensitivity, while classical protein purification lacks the versatility required for purifying multiple proteins for proteomics. We present a new metalloproteomics method based on three dimensions of metal-free liquid chromatography (HPLC) hyphenated online with inductively coupled sector-field mass spectrometry (ICP-sfMS): anion exchange chromatography (AEC) followed by either chromatofocusing (CF) or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and finally size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We used this 3D technique to purify naturally abundant metalloproteins from crude extracts mainly from plants but also from bacteria to a quantity and purity sufficient for protein identification and quantification by mass spectrometry (Tims-TOF-MS). Protein mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD056024. Sensitivity and signal/background ratio were sufficient to identify proteins at concentrations <1 nM and total amounts <1 pmol in the final SEC. As shown by application examples, the method can be immediately applied to various biological materials from a large range of organisms without individual optimization for single proteins or organisms. It can thus be used to resolve mechanisms of metal metabolism in various contexts, e.g., metal deficiency, nutrition, toxicity, and detoxification.",

Large extracellular vesicles (lEVs) extracted from urine samples of patients may contain information about prostate pathology and are, therefore, potential biopsies for early PCa detection. This research endeavors to create a urinary lEV-centric proteomic approach for early PCa identification. An integrated workflow utilizing functionalized magnetic beads, centrifugation, and filter membranes optimizes and expedites the analysis of urinary lEVs. To validate the stability and significance of lEV proteomic markers, the study employed multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) to assess the identified differentially expressed proteins in lEVs (lEV-DEPs) within a validation group for precise quantification. Furthermore, cell-line experiments were conducted to compare the proteomic profiles of lEVs, small EVs (sEVs), and cell membranes (CM). In total, 3549 urinary lEV proteins were captured, revealing 17 lEV-DEPs, with 12 confirmed through MRM. Notably, this isolation method reduced contaminants compared to centrifugation, facilitating the extraction of relatively large EVs. Pathway enrichment analysis of lEV-DEPs underscored their role in transitioning from inflammation to cancer, with specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) influencing PCa progression. A panel integrating four potential lEV-DEPs and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) exhibited a distinguished accuracy of 0.875, emphasizing the importance of lEV-DEPs over PSA in distinguishing PCa from prostatitis. Additionally, lEVs demonstrated significant protein content and pathway similarity with CM compared to sEVs. In conclusion, this investigation establishes a comprehensive protocol for isolating and characterizing urinary lEV proteomics, showcasing its efficacy in discriminating PCa from prostatitis. These results enhance diagnostic precision and offer fresh insights into the biological mechanisms underlying PCa, paving the way for improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

I already aim to lift heavy, but am going to switch to 3 full body workouts instead of 5 split body workouts. I’d like to add SIT and JT on my off days, looking for ideas of how others do that. I prefer to workout at home, and have access to a treadmill, rower, kettlebells, and smart gym.\n\nFor SIT (sprint interval training: 20-30s of 100% effort followed by complete recovery), I’m struggling a bit with going all out and getting my heart rate up in a short period of time with bodyweight activities. I am not a great runner, very heavy on my feet, and also don’t cycle - those are the two obvious choices for SIT, so wondering how else I can approach it.\n\nFor JT (jump training), are jumping jacks, jump rope, etc. enough, or should I try more jumps with more force/impact?\n\nI’ve read Next Level, but there just wasn’t enough detail for me to get a good idea of how to structure these workouts. Would love to hear how others incorporate these things!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/xxfitness) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nI do SIT on the elliptical on highest resistance for the 30 seconds, my Heartrate goes up to 90% after around 20s, and I get around 6 high intensity spikes in the 30 mins. For jump training, which I haven't started yet, she suggests jump squats or jumping onto and off a low bench or whatever. She mentioned jumping Jacks as well, not sure about the rope."

However, current detection methods face limitations in selectivity, sensitivity, and practicality. In this study, we developed a series of novel D-π-A structured fluorescent probes (PM-1, PM-2, PM-3, and PM-4), Among which PM-4 demonstrates weak monomer emission (540 nm) in aqueous solution. The pyridine side chain of PM-4 forms hydrogen bonds with the dual carboxylate groups of Asp/Glu, triggering the formation of emissive excimers. This process generates a new, enhanced red-shifted emission peak at 630 nm, enabling specific detection. The detection limits reached 1.26 μM (Asp) and 1.29 μM (Glu), with high selectivity. The formation mechanism of the probe-analyte complex was confirmed by NMR titration experiments. PM-4 successfully monitored diurnal fluctuations of Asp/Glu in saliva samples from healthy volunteers and concentration variations after smoking, revealing a correlation with emotional states (e.g., peak concentrations observed 10 min after smoking). The developed PM-4 probe integrates high sensitivity, selectivity, providing a powerful analytical tool for neurometabolic studies and disease biomarker detection. Its demonstrated performance highlights promising potential for both fundamental research and diagnostic product development."

In this study, we present a comprehensive aptamer-involved surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (aptamer-SERS)-based protocol specifically designed for large-scale clinical screening of the circulating protein MUC1 overexpressed in the majority of breast cancer cases. Central to our approach was a \"sandwich\" assay, where MUC1 was anchored between aptamer-functionalized bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) and magnetic nanobeads. The biosensor was applied to monitor MUC1 in serum samples through SERS signals from the reporter molecule 4-ATP, exhibiting a strong linear correlation across a wide dynamic range and the lower the limit of detection (LOD) of 2.96 fg/mL. To support clinical decision-making, the protocol was integrated with a machine learning (ML)model for the classification of SERS signal patterns, demonstrating performance metrics of 96% accuracy and 93.7% specificity when applied to diverse serum samples. This integration enabled robust, non-invasive preclinical screening that informs therapeutic regulation and patient monitoring long before clinical symptoms present. By establishing a scalable framework for continuous monitoring of MUC1 levels across large populations, our study offered a forward-thinking tool, namely, dual-aptamer-SERS biosensor, that may optimize individualized treatment planning and improve overall clinical management strategies."

Protein-based nanoparticle drug delivery systems (PNP-DDSs) have emerged as promising platforms to overcome limitations of conventional IBD therapies by improving drug stability and bioavailability while enabling colon-specific delivery. This review systematically classifies PNP-DDSs derived from natural proteins (albumin, gelatin, silk fibroin, and plant-derived proteins) and discusses their design principles along with strategies for intestinal targeting, including particle size and surface charge modulation, stimuli-responsive release (triggered by pH, reactive oxygen species, or enzymes), and active targeting. It highlights recent preclinical advances with oral PNP-DDSs delivering curcumin, resveratrol, 5-aminosalicylic acid, quercetin, and other anti-inflammatory agents, which demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these nanoplatforms in IBD models. Despite promising preclinical outcomes, clinical translation of PNP-DDSs remains challenging due to patient heterogeneity, manufacturing scale-up difficulties, and safety concerns. Future progress will require interdisciplinary innovation and optimization of multi‑stimuli-responsive designs for precise and safe clinical application of PNP-DDSs in IBD management."

SI is defined as CRP from 2 mg/L to 20 mg/L. The increased cost and use of healthcare services associated with SI is identified by comparing individuals with SI with individuals without SI. Statistical adjustments are made for age, sex, and comorbidities to control for confounding factors.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients with ASCVD and CKD, the presence of SI was significantly associated with higher healthcare interactions, with an average increase of 6.7 outpatient and 7.0 more inpatient contacts over the study period compared to those without SI. Furthermore, SI is associated with a 1.4-fold increase in healthcare expenditure, resulting in an excess cost of EUR 14,370 per patient over the first 3 years of the follow-up period.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The lack of a definitive onset date for SI complicates the analysis, as it is based on CRP tests conducted within 2 years of ASCVD and CKD diagnoses, potentially excluding individuals with prolonged SI prior to testing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SI is associated with higher healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with ASCVD and CKD."

The laminate employs a layering strategy with rose bengal and green light-induced crosslinking to facilitate assembly while enabling the controlled release of three bioactive molecules, vancomycin, Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1α). Mechanical properties were evaluated using a high-capacity load cell, revealing that multi-layer configurations exhibited reduced stiffness and tensile strength compared to single-layer laminates. Notably, incubation with Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDF) holds the potential to enhance interlayer cohesion and improve the mechanical integrity of 5-layer laminates. Furthermore, the composition of collagen within the laminate played a critical role in determining both mechanical behavior and release kinetics. Singular sheets of Endoform™ Natural (E) collagen displayed rapid release, while Geistlich Bio-Gide® (G) collagen sheets provided sustained release, reflecting their distinct structural characteristics.

Evidence shows that TTR contributes to neuroprotection, cognition, glucose regulation, pregnancy, muscle development, and bone mineralization. In several disease states, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and osteoporosis, higher TTR levels may be protective. Numerous studies have shown that low levels of TTR are associated with increased mortality overall and in relation to cardiovascular disease and several malignancies.\n\nPURPOSE: There is a growing portfolio of approved and investigational transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) treatments that differ in their mechanisms and effects on circulating TTR. When selecting an ATTR therapy, clinicians must decide whether to stabilize and preserve TTR and its functions or knockdown and drastically reduce TTR. This review summarizes the vital physiologic roles of TTR in health and disease. We consider the potential effects on normal biologic pathways that may occur while therapeutically suppressing TTR and discuss clinical decisions concerning ATTR therapies in the context of the summarized literature.\n\nDISCUSSION: TTR is essential for a broad range of physiologic processes and may confer clinically protective effects in neurologic and other organ systems. While a link between low TTR and severe disease and mortality is well established, it remains unclear whether long-term TTR suppression\n\nCONCLUSION: TTR serves vital physiologic roles across organ systems.

Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on DEMAGs. The PPI protein interaction network and machine learning were applied to identify Hub genes, which were also validated by GSE46474, an external validation set. We constructed a rat model of acute rejection of kidney transplantation and sequenced the transcriptome of the serum, and using the sequencing results, we analyzed the expression levels of the Hub gene. Then, a correlation analysis was carried out based on the Hub genes and different immune cell infiltration levels. Finally, GRNdb, miRDB, and GeneCards databases were applied to study the transcription factors, miRNAs, and regulatory drugs of Hub genes, respectively.\n\nRESULTS: The results of the Cibersort analysis revealed that M2-type macrophages were expressed higher in the Normal group.

In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections."

Participants were classified into two groups based on the timing of delivery: PE-delivery (delivery within 1 week of sample collection) and PE-non-delivery (no delivery within 1 week). Urine and serum samples were collected at the time of PE diagnosis, and cases were classified based on the presence of maternal or fetal complications.\n\nRESULTS: In total, 53 singleton pregnancies were analyzed and classified into the PE-delivery (n = 32) and PE-non-delivery groups (n = 21). No significant differences in L-FABP levels were observed between severe and non-severe PE cases. However, L-FABP levels were significantly higher in cases of severe PE due to maternal factors. In the PE-delivery group, urine and serum L-FABP levels were significantly elevated in cases requiring delivery within 1 week due to maternal indications compared to the PE-non-delivery group, whereas no such differences were found in cases with fetal indications. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed strong predictive performance of L-FABP levels for delivery within 1 week due to maternal deterioration, with areas under the curve of 0.892 (urine, cutoff: 12.3 μg/gCr) and 0.795 (serum, cutoff: 1.64 ng/mL).\n\nCONCLUSION: Maternal urine and serum L-FABP levels are closely associated with PE severity due to maternal complications and may serve as reliable biomarkers for imminent maternal deterioration."

    "text": "The human gut microbiome impacts host health through metabolite production, notably short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from digestion-resistant carbohydrates (DRCs). While DRC supplementation offers a means to modulate the microbiome therapeutically, its effectiveness is often limited by the microbial community's complexity and individual variability in microbiome functionality. We utilized genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from the AGORA collection to provide a system-level overview of the metabolic capabilities of human gut microbes in terms of carbohydrate trophic networks and propose improved therapeutic interventions, based on microbial community design. Our study inferred the capability of AGORA strains to consume carbohydrates of varying structural complexities - including DRCs - and to produce metabolites amenable to cross-feeding, such as SCFAs. The resulting functional database indicated that DRC-degrading abilities are rare among gut microbes, suggesting that the presence or absence of specific taxa can determine the success of DRC-based interventions. Additionally, we found that metabolite production profiles exceed family-level variation, highlighting the limitations in predicting intervention outcomes based on gut microbial composition assessed at higher taxonomic levels. In response to these findings, we integrate reverse ecology principles, network analysis and GEM community modeling to guide the design of minimal yet resilient microbial communities to better guarantee intervention response (purpose-based communities). As a proof of principle, we predicted a purpose-based community designed to enhance butyrate production when used in conjunction with DRC supplementation that displays resilience under nutritional stress, such as amino acid restriction. We further seeded the identified purpose-based community into modeled human microbiomes previously demonstrated to accurately predict SCFA production profiles. The analysis confirmed that such intervention significantly promotes butyrate production across samples, with those that presented a comparatively lower butyrate production pre-intervention displaying the largest increase in butyrate production after seeding. Our work highlights the potential of combining GEMs with community design to infer effective microbiome interventions, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes."

Ninety-eight healthy young adults aged 20-49 completed the study intervention, and they received either an MFGM powder containing 1.7 g of fat and 160 mg of sphingomyelin or an isocaloric placebo powder daily throughout 4 weeks (3 times/week) of power training. Physical strength tests and body composition measurements were conducted before and after the four-week intervention. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline values as a covariate was carried out to test differences in post intervention values between groups.\n\nRESULTS: Ingestion of MFGM significantly improved peak torque (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that daily MFGM supplementation combined with power training are effective to improve instantaneous physical strength, such as muscle strength and power, compared with placebo in healthy young adults."

This study examined the relationship between umbilical cord blood levels of angiopoietin-like protein 7 (ANGPTL7) in term neonates born to mothers with GDM and myocardial development, assessing its potential as an early predictive marker.\n\nMETHODS: The study involved 46 newborns exposed to GDM and 46 healthy controls. Measure the interventricular septum (IVS) thickness through cardiac ultrasound and evaluate the level of ANGPTL7 in umbilical cord blood using the ELISA method.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of myocardial hypertrophy in the GDM group was 19.6%, significantly higher than 0% in the control group, and increased to 27.3% in neonates of mothers with GDM and poor glycaemic control. ANGPTL7 levels in the GDM group were significantly elevated compared to the control group (1.87 vs. 1.11 ng/mL). Furthermore, these levels were positively correlated with IVS thickness. In the poorly-controlled GDM subgroup (GDM-A), neonates had significantly higher ANGPTL7 levels and IVS/LVPW ratio (1.19 vs. 1.03), indicating more severe myocardial abnormalities.\n\nCONCLUSION: ANGPTL7 may contribute to myocardial hypertrophy in GDM neonates by promoting insulin resistance. Monitoring ANGPTL7 levels in umbilical cord blood could help identify high-risk neonates and guide optimal glycaemic management during pregnancy. Although the sample size was small, the study offers new evidence of ANGPTL7's clinical utility.

This study investigates the causal role of diverse plasma complement proteins in CKD and its clinical types to discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\n\nMETHOD: Using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), we examined the causal relationships between 28 plasma complement proteins and CKD outcomes. Plasma complement levels were sourced from a genome-wide association studies involving 35,559 Icelandic individuals, CKD outcome sourced from the FinnGen R11 and kidney function indicators sourced from CKDgen. Protein-protein interactions and GO enrichment analyses were used to identify related biological pathways.\n\nRESULTS: MR analysis identified causal relationships between 19 specific plasma complement proteins and CKD, 6 of which remained significant after false discovery rate correction. In addition, CR1 and CFD were not only found to be risk factors for CKD, but were also determined to be positively correlated with membranous nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, respectively.

A total of 4,897 participants aged 40 to 79 years were included. Weighted multivariate linear regression models assessed the association between AIP and serum α-Klotho (SαKl) levels, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Sex-stratified analyses explored potential effect modification.\n\nRESULTS: Mean ± SE SαKl level was 869.9 ± 8.6 pg/mL in females and 826.6 ± 10.2 pg/mL in males; mean ± SE AIP values were -0.09 ± 0.01 and 0.05 ± 0.01, respectively.

    "text": "Adynamic bone disorder, common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), results from reduced bone turnover, often due to medications such as calcimimetics or high-dose vitamin D analogs that induce low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Numerous factors contributing to PTH hyporesponsiveness, which also induces low bone turnover, include deficient PTH, uremic toxins like indoxyl sulfate, malnutrition, inflammation, and diabetes. Diagnosis typically involves bone biopsy, although it is inconvenient. Biomarkers like bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and intact PTH (iPTH) show promise in distinguishing between low and high bone turnover. Meta-analysis suggests that levels of iPTH below 150 pg/mL or BALP levels below 20 μg/l indicate low bone turnover. Treatments aim to improve bone density without hindering repair, with osteo-anabolic medications being favored for low PTH levels and anti-resorptive agents being cautioned. Romosozumab, while effective, has safety concerns that limit its use. Uremic toxins are reduced by AST-120 treatment, which alleviates PTH hypo-responsiveness and bone toxicity. Adjunctive measures include addressing vitamin D deficiency, and diabetes, and utilizing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. Overall, BALP and iPTH appear as potential promising biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring adynamic bone disorder in CKD, effectively guiding therapeutic interventions."

In vitro, human kidney proximal tubule cells 2 were pretreated with Ses, and then models of kidney injury induced by APAP were established. Kidney damage was evaluated by morphological, inflammation, oxidative stress and protein analyzes.\n\nRESULTS: Ses significantly improved APAP-induced nephrotoxicity in vitro and in vivo models. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in ferroptosis and apoptosis signaling pathways, identifying heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) as a core protein. In the Ses-treated group, ferroptosis and apoptosis were significantly inhibited, while HMOX1 was effectively restored. In cell experiments, both the HMOX1 agonist hemin and Ses attenuated ferroptosis and apoptosis. HMOX1 inhibitor Zinc Protoporphyrin significantly eliminated the protective effect of Ses.\n\nCONCLUSION: Ses alleviates APAP-induced renal injury by mediating the inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis via HMOX1.

Engineering the Fc regions to achieve desirable pharmacology and pharmacokinetics is a widely adopted strategy in drug development. Fc regions can be modified through amino acid substitutions and glycoengineering, resulting in enhanced or reduced effector functions, preferential binding to FcR subtypes, or pH-dependent binding to FcRns. These alterations in binding and effector activities of mAbs may potentially also be accompanied by undesirable effects or safety concerns. Critical assessment of pharmacology and safety in the nonclinical setting is essential before exposing humans to the engineered mAb. For Fc-modified mAbs, the choice of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology and safety models need to account for species differences in FcR expression and function, potentially divergent effects of Fc modifications in humans versus nonclinical species, impact of target and cognate ligand expression patterns, and potential impact of emergent anti-drug antibodies directed against the mAb. Using a variety of industry case studies, we highlight key aspects of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology testing strategies, factors that influence choice of nonclinical models, translatability of findings, input from health authorities and suggest best practice approaches for nonclinical testing of Fc modified mAbs."

Model-informed drug discovery and development is a powerful approach that has been successfully used to support research and development. The goal of this analysis was to expand a published brain minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) model to investigate the optimal TfR binding affinity for maximal brain delivery in NHP and to facilitate prediction of the PK of anti-TfR bsAbs in humans from NHP data. Literature data for plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain exposure after administration of non-TfR mAbs and monovalent bsAbs with respect to TfR in NHP were used to develop the TfR mPBPK model. Clinical validation using human PK data from plasma and CSF for the monovalent anti-TfR bsAb trontinemab demonstrated good predictive performance without major model recalibration. The availability of the TfR mPBPK model is envisaged to provide better understanding of the relationship between TfR binding affinity, dose, and brain exposure, which would lead to more robust selection of lead candidates and efficacious dosing regimens."

Five PFAS were measured and all patients were followed up till 31 December 2019. Multivariate linear, logistic, and Cox regressions were used to evaluate the associations between PFAS exposure and renal function, mortality. Stratified subgroups were analyzed based on baseline characteristics. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was used in sensitivity analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Among 1503 CKD patients included, baseline renal function declined in 701 patients (44.4%) and 462 patients (24.9%) died during the follow-up. Single exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) was positively associated with renal function decline (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: PFAS single and mixed exposure were closely related to renal function and renal progression in adult CKD patients.

We aimed to explore the causal effects of serum metabolites on graft dysfunction and the mediating role of inflammatory proteins.\n\nMETHODS: We first analyzed the causal association of 1,091 serum metabolites and 91 inflammatory proteins with graft dysfunction by Mendelian randomization (MR) to find the most important indicators and calculated the mediating role of inflammatory proteins. Second, we further intergrated the single-cell analysis, machine learning, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods to validate the role of the inflammatory protein in rejected transplanted kidneys.\n\nRESULTS: In MR analysis, the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method showed that N-acetylaspartyl glutamate (NAAG) levels reduced the risk of graft dysfunction (OR 0.648, 95% CI 0.522-0.805). Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta (IL-2RB) mediated the association between NAAG and graft dysfunction with a mediation ratio of 11.35% (95% CI 1.85%-24.69%). In transplanted kidneys, IL-2RB is predominantly expressed elevated in T cells from rejection samples and is associated with decreased renal function. 10 hub genes were identified based on T cells with high and low expression of IL-2RB, of which NGboost reached AUC 0.77. The SHAP method obtained the gene with the greatest model contribution: the IL-2RB gene.\n\nCONCLUSION: NAAG plays a protective role in graft dysfunction, and part of the effect is mediated by inhibition of IL-2RB, which is verified as an important gene that functions in transplant kidney rejection. NAAG and IL-2RB may be novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets for graft dysfunction."

We aim to explore the potential molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of TLS in IgA nephropathy by bioinformatics methods, hoping to provide treatment methods. The datasets GSE226840, GSE237120, and GSE116626 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were employed to investigate the potential therapeutic targets of TLS in IgAN. The R was used to obtain the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of three datasets, and the Venny was used to intersect the above three parts of the DEGs to obtain the common DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed on obtained genes using Metascape. Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The intersection of the above common differential genes and IgAN differential genes was obtained by Venny tool. The Nephroseq platform was used to screen core genes and explore their relationship with clinical features. Meanwhile, CIBERSORT was utilized to further delve into the correlation between core genes and immune cells. 92 TLS-related genes and 486 IgAN related genes were obtained, and 6 common genes were obtained after crossing the two genes. The intersection genes were verified by Nephroseq, and CDKN1A, CD83, DUSP6, and CD48 were identified as core genes. At the same time, there were differences in the composition of immune cells between the disease group and the control group when the immune infiltration analysis was performed. And by further analyzing the correlation between core genes and immune cells, the study found that the four genes were positively correlated with T cells, B cells, plasma cells, and other immune cells. By exploring the relationship between core genes and clinical features, CDKN1A and DUSP6 were negatively correlated with Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and positively correlated with proteinuria in IgAN patients. CD48 was negatively correlated with GFR and positively correlated with Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN). The four genes highly associated with TLS and IgAN were screened using GEO database in study. And CDKN1A, CD83, DUSP6 and CD48 may provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TLS in IgAN. At the same time, studies have found that T cells, B cells, and macrophages may be involved in the formation of TLS in IgAN."

However, this approach may compromise chirality-dependent therapeutic efficacy and potentially underestimate the significance of chirality in nanomedicine. Herein, supramolecular chiral nanoparticles, D/L-arginine (Arg)-meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (TCPP), were constructed through the self-assembly of D/L-Arg and TCPP. Owing to the interaction between D/L-Arg and TCPP, chirality transfer from D/L-Arg to TCPP was observed, which resulted in the direct chiral induction of TCPP within supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, driven by enantioselective interaction with proteins, D-Arg-TCPP demonstrated 1.5-fold greater cellular uptake efficiency than L-Arg-TCPP via caveolin-dependent endocytosis. Thus, the enantiomer-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capacity-induced photodynamic anti-tumor performance, with D-Arg-TCPP exhibiting 1.9 times higher efficacy than L-Arg-TCPP, was verified. Our findings not only elucidate the mechanisms underlying chirality-dependent behavior of porphyrin-based supramolecular assemblies, but also pave a new avenue for optimizing chirality-mediated cancer therapy."

This study aimed to developa nomogram for predicting recurrence in patients with high-risk GISTand to provide guidance for adjuvant therapy.\n\nMETHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from 971 patients with high-risk GIST who underwent genetic testingat 13 centers in China. A nomogram was constructed in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort.\n\nRSEULTS: The training and validation cohorts included 696 and 275 patients, respectively. The nomogram incorporated blood plateletlevels, total protein, tumor location, tumor size, mitotic count, tumor rupture, Ki-67 index, and gene mutations. The C-index and AUC were 0.758 and 0.781 in the training cohort and 0.841 and 0.755, respectively, in the validation cohort. Calibration and DCA curves confirmed favorable discrimination, calibration accuracy, and clinical benefits. Using the nomogram, patients were categorized into a general high-risk groupand a very high-risk group. Among the general high-risk group, no significant difference in RFS was observed between patients who received adjuvant imatinib for 2.5 years or longer. Conversely, in the very high-risk group, patients receiving adjuvant imatinib for five or more years had markedly improved RFS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on the largest nomogram-related multicenter study in high-risk GIST, the nomogram accurately predicted RFS in patients with high-risk GIST and provided guidance on adjuvant therapy for the first time. For general high-risk patients, 3 years of adjuvant imatinib is adequate, whereas very high-risk patients benefit significantly from more than 5 years of adjuvant imatinib."

At the same time, long-term food supply statistics from the FAOSTAT database show that these recommendations were at the root of fundamental dietary changes in Western countries, which resulted in a lower consumption of eggs and red meat, a higher consumption of cereals and poultry, a decline in average protein quality and, overall, in a higher glycemic load of the diet. Because current views on human nutrition are based primarily on highly unreliable questionnaire data from observational studies, the purpose of this commentary is to provide an alternative ecological (country-level) perspective and to trace the consequences of these nutritional changes using the FAOSTAT database in combination with available anthropological and health statistics. This comparison shows a close connection between the decline in protein quality and the sudden reversal of the positive height trend in some Western countries, after ∼150 years of continuous growth, which points to suboptimal levels of child nutrition. The sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is strongly correlated with the increasing consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates and sweeteners, and is also interconnected with the decrease in body height, because a high-quality, growth-stimulating diet during adolescence is inversely related to obesity. Given the long-term association between height and phenotypic IQ, the lower quality of nutrients in children's diet may also seriously affect intellectual potential and future civilizational development. In light of these findings, current nutritional strategies should be seriously reconsidered and recommended protein intakes for children must be urgently reevaluated."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: The consumption of sports drinks before, during, and after endurance exercise is a common practice among athletes. These drinks typically contain a variety of components, each of which has been shown to offer individual benefits. However, the combined effects of these components, as formulated in many sports drinks, have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to evaluate the impact of typical sports drink components on endurance performance, perceived exertion, and carbohydrate and fat metabolism, using a sequential additive design.\n\nMETHODS: Twelve healthy, trained endurance athletes aged 20 to 35 years participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study involved a baseline assessment and four exercise protocols, each separated by a 7-day washout period. During each exercise protocol, participants cycled for 40 minutes at 80% of their previously determined peak oxygen uptake , followed by an incremental protocol performed to voluntary exhaustion. Participants were randomly assigned to ingest one of four 300 ml solutions 60 and 30 minutes before each exercise protocol: solution A (placebo mineral water), solution B (dextrose and sodium), solution C (solution B + beetroot extract), or solution D (solution C + arginine and L-citrulline). Ventilation and heart rate were continuously monitored before and throughout the exercise. Lactate and glucose levels were measured at specific time points before and during the exercise, while ratings of perceived exertion were recorded every 10 minutes. Power output was continuously tracked throughout the exercise protocol. Body weight was assessed both before and after each exercise session.\n\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the four solutions in terms of time to exhaustion (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect of the tested sports drink compositions on performance during the selected exercise protocol to voluntary exhaustion appears minimal. This study found no significant differences between the solutions and the placebo. Thus, it can be concluded that consuming a dextrose-based solution before exercise did not offer any performance advantage over water. The additional substances included in solutions B, C, and D did not influence performance, carbohydrate metabolism, or fat metabolism during the exercise."

While apelin peptides are promising therapeutic candidates due to their critical role in vascular homeostasis, their efficacy as agonists is limited by insufficient lesion-specific targeting and suboptimal in vivo stability. Here, we developed an engineered extracellular vesicle (EV) platform for precise apelin delivery to PAH lesions, maximizing therapeutic impact. Using interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a type II transmembrane protein, we oriented the apelin peptide on the EV surface with its C-terminus fully exposed, preserving the critical binding interface for functional interaction with the apelin receptor. To further enhance targeting specificity, we integrated the PAH-targeting peptide CARSKNKDC (CAR), which selectively binds to heparan sulfate overexpressed on PAH endothelial cells, into the IFITM3-apelin scaffold, creating CAR-Apelin EVs. This dual-engineered EVs demonstrated exceptional targeting and therapeutic efficacy in PAH models. CAR-Apelin EVs significantly reversed pathological vascular remodeling and improved cardiac function, as evidenced by reduced right ventricular systolic pressure and hypertrophy. Our findings establish CAR-Apelin EVs as a transformative therapeutic strategy, providing a targeted and effective approach to meet critical unmet needs in PAH treatment."

Nevertheless, its role in the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) remains to be elucidated.\n\nMETHODS: We identified the differentially expressed genes in the glomeruli of IgAN patients through weighted gene co-expression network analysis across three datasets. Through clinical renal pathological tissue and cellular experiments, we further validated the gene and investigated its relationship with the inflammatory markers and fibrosis indicators in IgAN.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to peritumoral normal tissues, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling pathway have been identified as key elements in IgAN pathogenesis from two GEO databases and a validation dataset. PCK1 was identified and validated as one of the most promising candidate genes. The expression of PCK1 in clinically collected kidney specimens was significantly downregulated in patients with IgAN compared to healthy controls. The expression of PCK1 was inversely correlated with clinical indicators such as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24-hour proteinuria. In experiments with SV40-transformed mouse glomerular mesangial cells (MCs), PCK1 and PPARγ protein expression levels were significantly decreased in polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1)-stimulated MCs, which contrasts with the increased expression of inflammatory and fibrotic factors. Overexpression of PCK1 inhibited cellular inflammation and fibrotic changes induced by pIgA1, demonstrating protective effects against cellular fibrosis similar to rosiglitazone.\n\nCONCLUSION: PCK1 exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect on mesangial cell inflammatory markers and fibrosis indicators in IgAN, potentially offering a novel therapeutic target for its treatment."

Gliadin, a component of gluten, triggers oxidative stress in celiac disease. Using sensitive analytical methods, especially in foods containing high amounts of these proteins, is crucial for food safety. Aptamer-based biosensors are widely preferred in electroanalytical methods. One of the promising approaches regarding biosensors is the studies in which aptamer-based sensors are combined with molecularly imprinted polymers. The antibody-like binding and ability of MIP to distinguish between molecules increases the method's selectivity. Using a platform modified with aptamer and molecularly imprinted polymer hybrid (MIP) as a new synthetic receptor film, this study presents a selective and sensitive label-free aptasensor for detecting a food allergy gliadin. For this purpose, screen printed gold electrode was used. The electrode surface was electrochemically coated with gold nanoparticles to bind the aptamer to the surface; then the aptamer-gliadin complex was dripped onto the surface and adhered to it, then, o-phenylene diamine monomer was used to synthesize a MIP surface. Gliadin was determined by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in a wide range from 0.25 fg/mL to 1000 pg/mL. The developed method calculated LOD for gliadin determination as 0.011 fg/mL and LOQ as 0.034 fg/mL. The devised aptasensor was not only capable to the discrimination of the commonly found allergen compounds such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein, and ara-H1, but also it could detect the gliadin in spiked real samples such as gluten-free bread, crackers, cookies and brown rice cakes samples in the high recovery range of 98.1-104.6 %.

Findings reveal growing interest in Nectin-4's role in cancer immunotherapy and ADC development. Urothelial carcinoma remains the primary focus, with breast and bladder cancers gaining traction. Key research priorities include optimizing ADC safety profiles, particularly managing cutaneous adverse events. Notably, dual targeting strategies combining Nectin-4 with TROP-2 show promise for next-generation ADC therapies. The study highlights evolving clinical needs, from target validation to treatment optimization, positioning Nectin-4 as a versatile biomarker bridging multiple cancer research domains. These insights emphasize the protein's translational potential while underscoring the importance of balancing therapeutic efficacy with toxicity management in ADC development."

    "text": "The nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2, an RNA-binding protein, is capable of undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) during viral infection, which plays a crucial role in virus assembly, replication, and immune regulation. In this study, we developed a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 NP-RNA interaction. Using this HTRF-based approach, we identified two natural products, sennoside A and sennoside B, as effective blockers of this interaction. Bio-layer interferometry assays confirmed that both sennosides directly bind to the NP, with binding sites located within the C-terminal domain. Additionally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that sennoside B significantly inhibited RNA-induced LLPS of the NP, while sennoside A displayed comparatively weaker activity. Thus, the developed HTRF-based assay is a valuable tool for identifying novel compounds that disrupt the RNA-binding activity and LLPS of the SARS-CoV-2 NP. Our findings may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 NP."

This study aims to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting the risk of autologous arteriovenous fistula thrombosis in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.\n\nMETHODS: A total of 1,016 patients who underwent hemodialysis at a tertiary A hospital in East China from February 2020 to March 2024 were retrospectively enrolled. The participants were randomly divided into a training set (711 people) and a validation set (305 people) at a ratio of 7:3. A risk prediction model was established according to the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis. The performance of the model was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), calibration curve analysis, the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and decision curve analysis (DCA).\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of autologous arteriovenous fistula thrombosis in patients on maintenance hemodialysis was 32%. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), catheterization history, hemodialysis duration, autologous arteriovenous fistula stenosis and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were independent risk factors for autologous arteriovenous fistula thrombosis. These five predictors were used to construct a predictive nomogram. The AUC was 0.818 in the training set and 0.826 in the validation set. The calibration curve of the nomogram was close to the standard curve, indicating that the model was well calibrated. The DCA results confirmed that the model provided good net clinical benefits.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this study, a predictive nomogram for arteriovenous fistula thrombosis was established and validated."

We recruited 178 women, including 73 who had experienced at least one early clinical pregnancy loss and 105 patients with one live birth and no history of pregnancy loss. Data on demographics, disease history, menstrual and reproductive history was collected. The case group patients were sampled immediately upon presenting with pregnancy loss at their first visit. The reference group patients underwent samples when they chose to participate voluntarily. All vaginal discharge was performed DNA Preparation and Metagenomics Sequencing. DNA extraction was performed using the phenol/trichloromethane method and the DNA fragments were then size-selected to 300-700 bp using magnetic beads. The selected fragments were repaired and ligated with indexed adaptors. The captured DNA was amplified again by PCR and circularized to create a single-stranded circular (ssCir) library. The ssCir library was subsequently amplified through rolling circle amplification (RCA) to produce DNA nanoballs (DNBs). The DNBs were then loaded onto a flow cell and sequenced using the DNBSEQ Platform. Nonparametric tests, including Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests, were employed. Relative abundance between groups was compared, and differential species selection was performed using the LEfSe software with linear discriminant analysis.\n\nRESULTS: 1. PCoA analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances at the species level revealed a difference between the groups (\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study highlights the association between vaginal microbiota dysbiosis and EPL, identifying specific microbial taxa that may contribute to pregnancy loss. These findings underscore the importance of the vaginal microbiome in reproductive health and open up new avenues for research into microbiome-based diagnostics and therapies.

Despite advancements in cancer therapies, challenges such as cellular toxicity and drug resistance to chemotherapy persist. Regulated cell death (RCD), once regarded as a passive process, is now recognized as a programmed mechanism with distinct biochemical and morphological characteristics, thereby presenting new therapeutic opportunities. Ferroptosis, a novel form of RCD characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and unique mitochondrial damage, differs from apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. It is driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipid peroxidation and is implicated in tumorigenesis, anti-tumor immunity, and resistance, particularly in tumors undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ferroptosis is associated with ischemic organ damage, degenerative diseases, and aging, regulated by various cellular metabolic processes, including redox balance, iron metabolism, and amino acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism. This review focuses on the role of epigenetic factors in tumor ferroptosis, exploring their mechanisms and potential applications in cancer therapy. It synthesizes current knowledge to provide a comprehensive understanding of epigenetic regulation in tumor cell ferroptosis, offering insights for future research and clinical applications."

However, previous research shows they commonly experience suboptimal intakes of energy and carbohydrate. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the causes of their poor dietary intakes. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess infantry trainees' dietary intakes and (2) explore their beliefs, barriers, and self-efficacy toward performance nutrition using the Health Belief Model (HBM).\n\nMETHODS: Participants undergoing their 17-week Australian Army Infantry Initial Employment Training (Infantry IET) were recruited. During weeks 1 and 17, self-reported dietary intakes were assessed, and four focus groups were conducted.\n\nRESULTS: Mean daily energy, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were 7864 ± 1135 kJ, 1.8 ± 0.6 g/kg, and 1.5 ± 0.3 g/kg, respectively, in week 1, and 9084 ± 2535 kJ/day, 2.2 ± 1.1 g/kg and 1.5 ± 0.2 g/kg, respectively, in week 17. Three themes and seven subthemes were developed from the focus group data, falling under the following HBM domains: Cues to Action, Perceived Barriers, and Self-Efficacy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Infantry trainees' ability to eat well for their health and performance was hindered by their limited time during their intensive training schedule, their limited access to a sufficient variety of healthy foods, and their limited self-efficacy regarding performance nutrition. They require further performance nutrition knowledge, especially in regard to adopting practical fueling and refueling strategies surrounding physical training, as well as access to a greater quantity and variety of healthy foods outside of their main mealtimes."

Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and Mann - Whitney U tests, were conducted to evaluate differences between professional and nonprofessional athletes, as well as between male and female participants.\n\nRESULTS: A high prevalence of dietary supplement use (91.1%) was observed among Polish athletes, with no significant differences between professional (95.8%) and nonprofessional (94.3%) athletes or between men (92.0%) and women (90.0%). The most frequently consumed supplements were sports drinks (63.9%), electrolyte supplements (51.6%), and isolated protein supplements (54.6%), vitamin D (71.6%), vitamin C (59.8%), with significantly higher intake among professional athletes. Male athletes were more likely than females to consume caffeine (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the widespread use of dietary supplements among Polish athletes, irrespective of competitive level or gender. While many athletes select supplements from AIS Group A, their knowledge of AIS classification and supplement certification programs remains limited. The high reliance on social media for supplement information, combined with the lack of professional guidance, underscores the need for improved education on safe and effective supplementation practices. Given the risks associated with supplement contamination, targeted initiatives should enhance athletes' awareness of anti-doping regulations and certified supplement options."

This systematic review is the first to comprehensively evaluate the anti-fibrosis mechanisms of AS-IV across heterogeneous cardiovascular disease animal models, including myocardial infarction, hypertension, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and myocarditis. The underlying mechanisms of the anti-fibrosis effects of AS-IV may include collagen metabolism, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation and, pyroptosis, antioxidants, improving mitochondrial function, regulating senescence, etc. Current evidence remains preclinical, with critical gaps in toxicological profiles, human safety thresholds, and clinical adverse reaction data. Future research must integrate robust toxicological evaluations, optimized combination therapies, and adaptive clinical trials to validate translational potential."

GO and GSEA-KEGG enrichment analyses were used to identify key biological functions and related pathways. Cytoscape software was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to obtain hub genes. The Nephroseq database was used to analyze the effect of hub genes on renal function, and the importance of lumican, a gene potentially related to DN progression, was further examined in clinical samples. GO and KEGG analyses were performed on lumican and its interacting proteins to elucidate their main biological functions and related pathways.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 1139 DEGs. GO enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in responses to hexose, cell-cell junctions. GSEA-KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were related to amino acid metabolism, adipokine signaling. Nephroseq database analysis revealed that hub genes were upregulated in the kidney tissues of patients with DN and that their expression was negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Lumican was among the top hub genes, and its expression was increased in renal tissues of DN patients as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.

It is categorized as ribosomopathy related to heterozygous allelic variations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a rare and etiologically heterogeneous condition, defined by the clinical triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We present a 5-year-and-2-month-old Chinese boy diagnosed with DBA combined with RPS. He was born with micrognathia, cleft palate, and airway obstruction, resulting in neonatal asphyxia and feeding difficulties, which constitute the classic triad of PRS. Low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, bilateral exotropia, a short neck, hypertelorism, a thenar muscle defect, and bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss were also observed in the boy. His motor and speech development were significantly delayed. In addition, he was found to be granulocytopenic at birth and severely anemic at 2 years and 10 months of age. Whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood revealed a heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), a novel pathogenic mutation in RPS28. RPS28 is one of the ribosomal protein (RP) genes, which may contribute to DBA-related phenotypes.

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: Renal tubular damage, a pivotal pathological feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD), predicts disease progression. While extreme nighttime sleep duration is linked to glomerular injury by prior studies, its impact on tubular damage remains unclear. Given that 7-9 h of sleep per night is widely recommended for maintaining overall health, this study aimed to assess whether long nighttime sleep duration is associated with renal tubular damage using both observational and genetic evidence.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed 2,683 adults in rural China to assess the link between nighttime sleep duration and renal tubular damage (measured by retinol-binding protein and β2-microglobulin). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to assess the causal relationship between prolonged nighttime sleep duration and elevated kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels.\n\nRESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression indicated that sleeping more than 9 h per night was associated with a 1.38-fold increased risk of renal tubular damage (95% CI: 1.11-1.71) compared to 7-9 h of sleep, with particularly pronounced effects observed in elderly individuals and women. MR analysis further supported a causal relationship between genetically predicted long nighttime sleep duration and elevated KIM-1 levels (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide observational and genetic evidence linking prolonged nighttime sleep to increased renal tubular damage risk. Given that 7-9 h of sleep per night is the widely accepted recommendation for maintaining overall health, our results emphasize the potential risks of excessive sleep duration exceeding 9 h."

However, a subset of patients relies on L-TDCs for extended periods. This study aims to characterize these patients and evaluate inflammatory markers.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective study, cross-sectional of 13 ESKD patients who had an L-TDC in place for at least 12 months at an urban hospital-based dialysis unit. This group was compared to 26 consecutive patients with stable AVFs. Key parameters analyzed included dialysis efficiency (urea reduction ratio, blood flow rates, venous/arterial pressures) and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP]).\n\nRESULTS: L-TDCs remained in use for an average of 40.6 ± 27.5 months (range: upto 113 months). Despite similar dialysis efficiency between groups (urea reduction ratio: 72.5% vs. 68.5%,\n\nCONCLUSION: Although L-TDC users achieve comparable dialysis efficiency to AVF patients, they experience persistent inflammation, as indicated by significantly elevated CRP levels.

MDW was measured at admission, and its diagnostic accuracy was compared with Sepsis-3 criteria. Survival rates on day 28 and 90 were also recorded. Additionally, five machine learning (ML) models were tested to enhance diagnostic efficacy. Of 488 subjects, 90 were in the sepsis group and 398 in the control group. MDW showed a diagnostic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82, comparable to C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) with AUCs of 0.78 and 0.82, respectively. With a cut-off value of 25.25, MDW had a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.76. The positive and negative predictive values were 44% and 95%, respectively. When MDW was combined with platelet count, serum albumin, and hemoglobin in a random forest model, the AUC improved to 0.931. The model achieved a sensitivity of 1.00 and specificity of 0.732. MDW is a useful diagnostic marker for sepsis in patients with HIV, with strong sensitivity and specificity. Combining MDW with other lab markers can further enhance diagnostic accuracy."

    "text": "Following an extensive literature review, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) has developed an official position on nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat sports. The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp, and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of the aerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0-4.0 g/kg, protein 1.2-2.0 g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at 24 h, prior to weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2% loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber intake of <10 g/day for 4 days. 10. During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision (optimally ~2-4% of body mass within 24 h of weigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-90 mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in. 13. Fast-acting carbohydrates at a tolerable rate of ≤ 60 g/h should follow oral rehydration solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to avoid gastrointestinal distress. 14. Post-weigh-in carbohydrate intake at 8-12 g/kg may be appropriate for combat athletes that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies during fight week. About 4-7 g/kg may be suitable for modest carbohydrate restriction. 15. Post weigh-in, rehydration/refueling protocols should aim to regain ≥10% of body mass to mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of rapid weight loss. 16. The long-term effects of frequent weight cuts on health and performance are unknown, necessitating further research."

DKR was calculated using the formula: (0.9 × fat +0.46 × protein) / (0.1 × fat +0.58 × protein + carbohydrates). Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for 19 confounders (demographics, comorbidities, lifestyle), restricted cubic splines, and mediation analyses. Robustness was assessed via propensity score matching.\n\nRESULTS: A higher DKR showed a linear dose-response reduction in depressive symptoms risk (OR = 0.13 per unit increase, 95 % CI:0.03-0.48, p = 0.003; Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 0.59, p = 0.012).. Mediation analyses revealed opposing effects: traditional obesity metrics (BMI, waist circumference, BRI) mediated adverse associations (-14.69 % to -11.43 %), while the body shape index (ABSI) displayed protective mediation (11.03 %, p < 0.001). None of the 12 inflammatory markers showed significant mediation, as indicated by p-values >0.05 or mediation proportions <5 %.\n\nCONCLUSION: DKR inversely associates with depressive symptoms risk, potentially through body composition remodeling rather than anti-inflammatory pathways. ABSI served as a positive mediator in the inverse association between DKR and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm causality and clinical utility of DKR."

SMU-C68, a human TLR1/2 specific small molecule agonist was identified, exhibiting a remarkable four-fold increase in biological activity compared to previously reported SMU-C80 with enhanced aqueous solubility. The cellular and protein level results confirmed that SMU-C68 facilitated the dimerization of TLR1 and TLR2 proteins, leading to the specific activation of TLR1/2 heterodimers. Upon activation, TLR2 recruited the adaptor protein MyD88, initiating downstream NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, treatment with SMU-C68 induced the release of pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, in human PBMC cells. Notably, SMU-C68 exhibited good selectivity towards human species and showed minimal effects on murine cells. Furthermore, in vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated that SMU-C68 exerted a positive influence on immune cell activation and tumor cell apoptosis. These findings strongly emphasize the potential of SMU-C68 in modulating immune responses and eliciting anti-tumor activity."

However, small molecule inhibitors targeting CHI3L1 are largely unexplored. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) investigation of the direct binding potential of reported CHI3L1 modulators (K284, G721-0282, CHI3L1-IN-1) revealed modest to undetectable direct CHI3L1 binding affinity. Herein, pharmacophore-based virtual screening of in-house library resulted in the discovery of G28 as the most potent small molecule CHI3L1 binder reported to date. The CHI3L1 binding affinity of G28 was validated using MST and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To evaluate the GBM-modulatory potential of G28, we conducted comprehensive pharmacokinetic and 3D spheroid studies alongside established CHI3L1 modulators. G28 demonstrated outstanding bioavailability and low toxicity, addressing key limitations faced by previous CHI3L1-targeted strategies. Notably, in 3D GBM spheroid models, G28 significantly outperformed reported CHI3L1 small molecule modulators, showing the most pronounced dose-dependent reductions in spheroid weight, migration, and viability. These findings position G28 as the most promising CHI3L1-targeted small molecule to date and a compelling candidate for GBM therapeutic development."

The primary hypothesis of this study was that oxidative damage, caused in vivo by oxidative stress-a key factor in aging and various inflammatory diseases-deteriorates bone tissue quality by damaging bone collagen, the main component of the bone's organic phase. To test this hypothesis in vitro, bovine cortical bone specimens were exposed to neutral hypochlorous acid solution (a potent reactive oxygen species) to induce oxidative damage, which was measured in terms of carbonylation. Carbonylation is a stable biomarker of protein oxidation. Mechanical testing revealed degradation of cortical bone mechanical properties due to oxidation. There was a marked degradation of mechanical properties, specifically pre-yield and post-yield properties such as tensile (30-40 %) and compressive (19-23 %) yield strength, as well as tensile (25-45 %) and compressive (11-16 %) ultimate strength. Exposure to neutral hypochlorous acid solutions increased the carbonyl content (normalized to collagen content), confirming protein oxidative damage. In addition, the observed carbonyl levels in the oxidized groups were similar to those measured in human cortical bone specimens. Thermo-analytical tests including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hydrothermal isothermal tension (HIT) tests, providing measures of collagen nativity and connectivity, revealed negative correlations with carbonyl content (r = -0.46, p = 0.0038). The hypothesis that physiological levels of oxidative damage generated in vitro degrade cortical bone mechanical properties by damaging the bone collagen has been confirmed. This suggests that oxidative damage of bone collagen is important towards understanding the degradation of bone quality in aging and various diseases."

Static DNA nanodevices have been engineered for the imaging and therapy, but they rely on the pre-assembly of DNA components and are limited by the low imaging contrast. Herein, we demonstrate the tumor microenvironment-responsive dynamic self-assembly of DNAzyme nanowires for high-contrast imaging of multiple mRNAs and chemotherapy. We design a cruciform DNA module (C-model) as a basic structural unit of DNAzyme nanowire, which consists of two DNAzyme strands and two substrate strands with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) being inserted into the C-models by inlaying between guanine and cytosine. Once approaching tumor cells, C-models with two split i-motif spontaneously assemble into a DNAzyme nanowire through protonation-driven Hoogsteen interaction in response to extracellular acidic microenvironments. Upon the internalization, intracellular TK1 mRNA and GalNAc-T mRNA hybridize with the overhangs of DNAzyme strands and substrate strands to form a stable DNAzyme/substrate/target three-way junction, inducing the cleavage of substrates by DNAzymes and the recovery of Cy5/Texas Red fluorescence. AS1411 aptamer-functionalized DOX-nanowires can selectively endocytose into cancer cells via AS1411-mediated recognition of nucleolin overexpressed on the cancer cell surface. Notably, the dynamic self-assembly of DNAzyme nanowires is characterized by efficient intracellular delivery and intrinsic resistance to nucleases, facilitating the high-contrast imaging of mRNAs. This method can accurately measure TK1 mRNA and GalNAc-T mRNA in living cells and discriminate multiple mRNAs in breast cancer tissues and their normal counterparts, providing a powerful platform for clinical diagnosis."

Participants completed self-reported questionnaires on demographic characteristics, physical health, activity levels, dietary index scores, dietary habits, and depressive symptoms.\n\nRESULTS: Participants were female (OR: 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.30-1.46), divorced or widowed (OR: 1.56, 95 % CI: 1.31-1.85), had a higher waist-hip ratio, and (OR: 2.22; 95 % CI: 1.43-3.43) and engaged in prolonged sedentary time (OR: 1.51; 95 % CI: 1.41-1.62) were more likely to report depressive symptoms.

The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated α-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that α-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, α-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects. As a result, repurposing traditional herbal medicines with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties presents a promising therapeutic approach. Studies suggest that berberine (BBR) may mitigate PD-related neuropathology. However, the exact mechanisms by which BBR exerts its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. This review explores the potential molecular pathways through which BBR could alleviate PD pathology."

Utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) in conjunction with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we identified proteins that exhibit significant associations with delirium. Additionally, we investigated the bidirectional relationship between delirium and aging-related indicators, such as the frailty index (FI), Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA), PhenoAge, and life expectancy. This was achieved through mediation analysis and Bayesian colocalization to assess the intermediary effects of these indicators. Finally, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the identified proteins via molecular docking studies.\n\nRESULTS: MR analysis revealed causal relationships between delirium and several aging-related indicators, including FI, IEAA, PhenoAge, and life expectancy. Eleven proteins were causally associated with delirium. Mediation analysis showed that the effects of HIBCH and IMPAD1 on delirium were mediated by PhenoAge, while IEAA mediated the effect of MICB. MST1's effect on delirium was mediated by FI and life expectancy. Bayesian colocalization confirmed strong associations between HIBCH, MST1, and delirium. Molecular docking studies indicated that MST1 and HIBCH exhibited low binding energies with midazolam and dexmedetomidine, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets.\n\nCONCLUSION: HIBCH and MST1 are key players in delirium pathophysiology and represent promising therapeutic candidates.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) from astrocytes drive this process, yet the release mechanism, potentially involving extracellular vesicles (EVs), remains unclear. Rab27a releases EVs from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by enabling their docking and fusion with the plasma membrane. We confirmed Rab27a expression, and its localization, subsequently, EV release was validated with CD9, Alix, and TSG101 markers. Rab27a-mediated EV release was confirmed in both Rab27a-induced and Rab27a-siRNA-treated cells. Rab27a-derived EVs inhibited neuronal cell growth, while Rab27a-siRNA EVs promoted neuronal growth. Our study also observed upregulated Rab27a expression in the rat contusion model of SCI. Further analysis showed increased CSPG expression in Rab27a-induced conditions via the Rho/ROCK pathway, with altered pAkt, and β-tubulin III, levels. Immunohistochemistry confirmed CSPG/Rab27a/GFAP and CSPG/CD9 co-localization in tissue sections, verifying that Rab27a mediates EV release containing CSPG from astrocytes. These findings suggest that Rab27a plays a crucial role in CSPG release via EVs and scar formation. Functional recovery was significantly improved with Rab27a-siRNA treatment, suggesting Rab27a as a potential target for astrocytic scar modulation in SCI.

Nevertheless, the inherent drawbacks of PROTAC technology hinder its clinical translation. The integration of nanotechnology with PROTAC molecules to create nano-PROTACs for combined therapy offers a promising solution. Among the various cancer treatment methods, phototherapy is considered the optimal choice to integrate with specific PROTACs due to its proven effectiveness and non-invasive nature. Herein, a nano-PROTAC formulation (ARV@PEG-ICG) consisting of a phototherapeutic agent named indocyanine green functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG-ICG) and a BRD4 degrader (ARV-825) was fabricated for cancer photo-immunotherapy. Activated by acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), ARV@PEG-ICG nanoparticles (NPs) will decompose rapidly for ARV delivery. PEG-ICG generated abundant ROS with laser irradiation, downregulating the expression of Bcl-xL and inducing the cleavage of PARP to stimulate cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the degradation of BRD4, a transcriptional cofactor, inhibited nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) generation to improve phototherapeutic efficacy. In a 4T1 breast tumor model, dying 4T1 cells released tumor associated antigens (TAAs) to serve as the immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer, facilitating DC maturation and T cell activation and amplifying systemic immune response. The distant tumor growth can also be inhibited due to the activation of long-term immune response. Overall, the current study aims to combine typical PROTAC with functional nanomaterials to form nano-PROTAC with high performance for PROTAC delivery mediated cancer treatment."

    "text": "Multifunctional wound dressings with rapid hemostasis, infection prevention, and tissue regeneration are crucial for treating hemorrhagic wounds. Inspired by the heterogeneous interfacial structure of natural skin, this study developed a chitosan(CS)-based Janus wound dressing with asymmetric wettability. The inner layer consists of methacrylated chitosan (CSMA), incorporating polydopamine-coated silica (PDA-SiO₂) nanoparticles to form a hydrophilic sponge with hemostatic, antioxidant, and pro-angiogenic properties. The outer layer is a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofiber membrane integrated with antibacterial agent zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), creating a hydrophobic barrier to prevent bacterial invasion. In vitro tests confirmed effective bacterial resistance, while hemostasis assays demonstrated enhanced platelet and red blood cell aggregation, accelerating coagulation. In vivo evaluations using rat liver injury and tail amputation models confirmed superior hemostatic performance, with blood loss reduced by 0.44 g and 0.23 g, respectively, and bleeding time shortened by 41.52 s and 59.47 s compared to Gauze. Furthermore, in full-thickness skin wound models, accelerated healing was achieved through infection prevention, increased collagen deposition (20.82 % higher than Control), and stimulated angiogenesis (3.10 % higher CD31 expression). These findings highlight CM@PS/TZ as a promising Janus dressing integrating antibacterial activity, hemostasis, and pro-angiogenic effects, offering an innovative solution for hemorrhagic wound treatment."

However, the SGLT2 inhibitors exist potential risks including weight loss and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. We designed and synthesized a series of O-glucoside derivatives by introducing nitrogen-containing heterocyclic fragments. Among them, compound E9 showed the most protective effect on the glucose-free DMEM-induced injured cardiomyocytes, and the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of these compounds were preliminarily evaluated in cardiomyocyte injury model. Furthermore, compound E9 significantly enhanced the inhibition of SGLT2, NHE1, and SOD enzyme activity, increased ATP levels in damaged cardiomyocytes, and suppressed Ang II-induced myocardial fibrosis, the autophagy receptor protein P62 and the expression of cell injury markers. Additionally, compound E9 significantly improved cardiac function in TAC-induced HF mice, inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen deposition, ameliorated myocardial tissue damage, enhanced mitochondrial autophagy in injured cardiomyocytes, and ultimately increased survival rates in HF mice. In conclusion, this study reveals that the novel O-glucoside derivative E9 was a promising compound for the treatment of heart failure."

Alternative proteins, including plant-based, cultured meats, insects, algae, and microbial proteins, offer promising solutions; however, knowledge of their digestibility is limited, and the reported documents are often quite low. For instance, plant proteins contain anti-nutritional factors like phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors, which hinder absorption. Similarly, insects, algae, and microbial proteins have complex cellular structures or compounds that can interfere with protein breakdown and absorption. On the other hand, cultured meats may lack certain components critical for optimal digestion. Thus, novel and conventional processing methods are being studied to improve digestibility. In this context, continued research is essential to refine these techniques for different protein sources, ensuring a sustainable production of alternative proteins with high nutritional quality."

Quercetin increased protein digestion in the stomach and small intestine, while gallic and caffeic acids only increased its digestion in the stomach. Quercetin and caffeic promoted nearly iron release at all polyphenol-to-complex levels studied (0.5:1 to 3:1), whereas gallic acid only promoted iron release at higher ratios (3:1). Polyphenol retention after digestion was relatively low (1 %-7 %), except for caffeic acid (21.5 % at 3:1). A Caco-2 cell assay showed that ferritin production was enhanced at high gallic acid levels (3:1), and intermediate quercetin levels (1:1), but not under other conditions. These findings suggest that polyphenol-protein-iron interactions can be modulated to enhance iron bioavailability, which may be important for iron fortification strategies."

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression, Pearson correlation, and mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate odds ratios and associations between inflammatory indicators and depression.\n\nRESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed significant negative associations between four inflammatory indicators (CRP, C-reactive protein; PC, platelet count; SII, systemic immune-inflammation index; PPN, product of platelet count and neutrophil count) and HDL cholesterol, as well as between HDL cholesterol and depression, while the inflammatory indicators were significantly positively correlated with depression (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for covariates, demonstrated that elevated levels of these four inflammatory indicators (CRP: adjusted OR = 1.011, CI = 1.003-1.025; PC: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.004; SII: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.003; PPN: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.004) were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression in the total study population.

The development of an analysis method for the sensitive monitoring of antifungal drugs is crucial, given their narrow therapeutic index.

Their presence has been detected in human tissues, including blood and placental tissue, raising concerns about developmental effects. However, MPs' effects on the development of human organs are still mostly unknown. The kidney is essential to detoxification and waste excretion in the body and is highly sensitive to toxic substances, making it an important focus for research on toxicity. To study kidney development, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived kidney organoids offer a useful in vitro model. This research specifically examines the consequences of PS-MPs on the differentiation of hiPSCs into kidney organoids. Different concentrations of PS-MPs (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μg/mL) were set according to the concentration of PS-MPs detected in blood at 1.6 μg/mL. The aim is to understand how environmental contaminants may impact kidney development at the cellular level. Our findings indicate that PS-MP exposure leads to nephron progenitor cell damage and disrupts key processes involved in kidney development, including nephron formation and epithelial cell differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PS-MPs induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, activate the Bcl-2 protein family, and trigger apoptosis via the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 signaling pathway. This disruption ultimately impairs normal kidney organoid formation. These results underscore the detrimental impact of PS-MPs on embryonic kidney development and highlight the urgent need for further investigation into the health risks associated with microplastic exposure during early human development."

However, it remains unknown whether this posttranslational modification occurs on ciliary membrane proteins. Herein, by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we demonstrate that multiple membrane proteins localized in the ciliary transition zone undergo core fucosylation, an N-linked glycosylation specifically catalyzed by fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8). In-depth analysis reveals that FUT8 interacts with transmembrane protein 67 (TMEM67), a transition zone component closely linked to ciliopathies, and catalyzes its core fucosylation. Functional investigation shows that core fucosylation stabilizes TMEM67 by impeding its degradation via the autophagy pathway, thereby ensuring its proper localization to the transition zone to promote cilium formation. Fut8-deficient mice exhibit ciliary defects in multiple organs, such as the kidney, brain, and trachea. These findings uncover a critical role for TMEM67 core fucosylation in ciliogenesis and have important implications for the pathogenesis of ciliopathies."

Gremlin 1 (GREM1), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist family, has emerged as a central regulator of cellular and extracellular dynamics, exhibiting dual roles in oncogenesis and fibrosis. By modulating BMP and TGF-β signaling pathways, GREM1 orchestrates critical pathogenic processes, including immune evasion, stromal dynamics, fibroblast activation, and angiogenesis. This review compiles current mechanistic insights into GREM1's dual roles in cancer and fibrosis, highlighting its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target. GREM1 contributes to tumor progression by promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and therapy resistance while driving extracellular matrix deposition and tissue remodeling in fibrotic disorders. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including demethyleneberberine (DMB), anti-GREM1 antibodies, and circular RNAs, demonstrate potential in mitigating GREM1-driven pathological processes. GREM1's pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cancer and fibrosis highlights its promise as a target for innovative combination therapies and biomarker-based precision medicine approaches.

T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), which plays a crucial role in the proliferation of T-cells and B-cells, is a close homologue of PTP1B, sharing 74 % sequence similarity within the catalytic domain. Although considerable efforts have been made to develop a selective and potent PTP1B inhibitor, no molecule has yet been developed as a drug. However, a few candidate compounds reached phase II clinical trials, but their further study was discontinued due to suboptimal efficacy and the manifestation of undesirable side effects. In this review, we aimed to decipher the complications associated with the PTP1B enzyme and the design strategies used by various research groups to develop small-molecule inhibitors, emphasising the structure-activity relationship of small molecules synthesized for this target. This review also delineates the molecular features, which will aid in designing rational approaches and foster further research into this target of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

This review explores key Generative AI models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), flow-based models and Transformer-based models, with Transformers gaining prominence due to the abundance of text-based biological data and the success of language models like ChatGPT. The paper discusses molecular representations, performance evaluation metrics, and current trends in Generative AI-driven drug discovery, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs), drug-target interactions (DTIs) and de-novo drug design. However, these approaches face significant challenges, including applicability domain issues, lack of interpretability, data scarcity, novelty, scalability, computational resource limitations, and the absence of standardized evaluation metrics. These challenges hinder model performance, complicate decision-making, and limit the generation of novel and viable drug candidates. To address these issues, strategies such as hybrid models, integration of multiomics datasets, explainable AI (XAI) techniques, data augmentation, transfer learning, and cloud-based solutions are proposed. Additionally, a curated list of databases supporting drug discovery research is provided. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for optimized AI models, robust validation methods, interdisciplinary collaboration, and future academic efforts to fully realize the potential of Generative AI in advancing drug discovery."

Considering their multifactorial nature, research has focused on the study of small molecules able to simultaneously tackle different targets involved in their onset and progression. In this paper, two sets of acylaminopyrazole-based compounds were designed to exploit the aminopyrazole core as a privileged structure properly decorated with an acyl moiety and a further amide function, connected with a proper spacer. Indeed, acylated aminopyrazoles could be able to establish the appropriate hydrogen bond pattern to both bind GSK-3β, responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation, prevent the formation of insoluble Aβ-protein aggregates and have the structural features to show chelating properties towards metals involved in neuroinflammation. The collection of compounds was tested in vitro for GSK-3β inhibition activity, antiaggregating and chelating properties. Selected compounds were able to inhibit GSK-3β in the low micromolar range with a reversible and competitive mechanism of action, as established by Microfluidic Mobility Shift Assay (MMSA) and showed metal chelating ability. Preliminary Structure Activity Relationships (SARs) to hit these distinct and interconnected targets for neuromodulation were established. Finally, selected compounds showed good apparent permeability values in parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) together with good cellular safety profile. The collected results validated acylaminopyrazole as promising scaffold for the development of multitarget-directed ligands. Compounds 1c and 4c emerged as promising prototypes, and deserve further optimization in the search for drug candidates for polypharmacological approach in neurodegenerative disease."

The effects of ultrasonic parameters on preparation performance were evaluated, along with their influence on the structure, digestion, cellular uptake, and cellular protection against oxidative stress. The results showed that both encapsulation and ultrasonic treatment significantly enhanced the Qu embedding rate (ER), yield, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the nanoliposome by 43.15 ± 1.29 %, 8.57 ± 0.74 %, and 24.38 ± 1.53 %, respectively, with an 87.50 ± 3.28 % decrease in diameter compared to unsonicated MP-Qu-Lipo. Moreover, compared to the monomeric forms, ultrasonic-assisted co-encapsulation significantly improved the digestive and intracellular bioavailability of Qu and MP by 25.29 ± 1.31 % and 39.33 ± 2.41 %, and 28.22 ± 2.04 % and 32.59 ± 1.97 %, respectively, at a high dose of 0.4 mg/mL. Ultrasound further increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), while decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, compared to the unsonicated liposome. These effects were attributed to a significant downregulation of the kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) inhibitor (14.29 ± 0.93 %) and upregulation of the antioxidant-related genes nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (8.00 ± 0.72 %) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (6.90 ± 0.54 %). Furthermore, ultrasonic treatment reduced the cell apoptosis rate by 5.58 ± 0.21 % and enhanced cell protection by 6.89 ± 0.37 %. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress-cell protection and their interaction with ultrasonic treatment.

L-based phytoconstituents was developed. We employed machine learning (ML) data pre-processing, screening of differentially expressed transcripts and genes, identification of common transcriptional signatures and pathways and function enrichment analysis of dengue infection; and protein-protein interaction network construction and identification of hub genes. ML data revealed that NS5 mRNA was downregulated by betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside. Moreover, administering these compounds can alleviate host innate immune factor suppression mediated by NS5, thereby exhibiting antiviral activity. Molecular docking and pharmacokinetics studies revealed a potential therapeutic role of betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside phytoconstituents as potent antiviral phytocompounds. MD simulation and post-simulation analysis, including principal component analysis and dynamic cross-correlation, confirmed the antiviral therapeutic potency of betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside against dengue virus infection.

This study prepared carboxymethyl starch (CMS)-whey protein isolate (WPI) crosslinked complexes (CMS-WPI/TA) by regulating the interaction in the CMS-WPI system by tannin (TA), and explored the effects of the complexes on the secretion of satiety hormones. The results showed that after the addition of TA, the interaction in CMS-WPI system shifted from electrostatic interactions to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, forming more compact, uniform, and ordered TA-crosslinked complexes. In vitro simulated digestion results indicated that the digestion rates of CMS and WPI in CMS-WPI/TA2 in the upper gastrointestinal tract were reduced to 5.77 % and 26.33 %, respectively, thus permitting most of the CMS and WPI to reach the colon and be degraded by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, peptides, and amino acids. These metabolic products can stimulate the sustained secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) by L cells, with their secretion increased by 101.02 % and 106.30 % compared to the blank group, respectively. The TA-crosslinked complexes also increased the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Dialister and Blautia, and reduced the abundance of harmful gut microbiota such as Collinsella.

This study investigated the changes in gel properties, endogenous enzyme activities, flavor characteristics and metabolic profile during mechanical pre-dehydration of minced fish, compared to the traditional washing process, in order to understand the relationship between changes in endogenous components and processing quality. The results showed that the pre-dehydration process preserved some of the TGase activities (65.96 U/mg) but also some of the proteases and some metabolites (e.g. Histamine and Phosphatidylcholine) that are detrimental to the gelling process, and the gel strength of the obtained surimi gels was lower but acceptable than that of the washed surimi gels (390.97 g·cm and 464.51 g·cm). The gel strength of unwashed surimi was unacceptable (284.03 g·cm). Pre-dehydrated surimi preserved higher levels of amino acids, glycerolipids, and glycerophospholipids than washed surimi, leading to enhanced flavor precursor retention and generation of volatile compounds during gelling. Compared to washed surimi gel, pre-dehydrated surimi gels exhibited stronger warm-over and fishy flavor (Heptanal, Octanal, et al), while retaining more desirable aromas (3-Hexanone, 1-hexanol, et al). This study demonstrates that mechanical pre-dehydration balances gel quality and flavor retention while reducing water usage, offering a sustainable strategy for surimi processing."

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that TMAO promotes lipid deposition in both in vivo and in vitro models. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, the conversion of TMA to TMAO was increased, and supplementation with TMAO exacerbated lipid accumulation and liver dysfunction. In contrast, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-Sh alleviated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis identified heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β) as a potential downstream effector of TMAO. In both HepG2 cells and HFD-fed mice, TMAO upregulated HSP90β expression, perturbing protein homeostasis. FMO3 Sh reduced HSP90β protein activity and mRNA levels. Meanwhile, proteomic analysis revealed that the TMAO/HSP90β axis disrupts mitochondrial protein homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by MPTP opening, MMP decrease, and ROS production. In vivo, activation of the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by swollen mitochondria with reduced cristae observed via TEM. Notably, FMO3 Sh ameliorated mitochondrial function by suppressing the TMAO/HSP90β axis. In summary, our study demonstrates that the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis promotes MAFLD progression by targeting mitochondrial protein homeostasis and influencing lipid metabolism."

Fulvestrant, developed by AstraZeneca as the first selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), effectively downregulates ER levels by reducing its stability, which leads to degradation through protein degradation mechanisms. However, the administration of Fulvestrant via the intramuscular route has imposed significant limitations on its clinical application, prompting the exploration of active oral bioavailable SERDs. Furthermore, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies have evaluated the efficacy of various oral SERDs in terms of their ability to degrade the ER, binding capacity, safety profiles, and numerous other indicators. This paper reviews recent advancements in oral SERDs, discusses their evolutionary relationships, and outlines the processes of structural modification, providing valuable insights for future research and applications."

DKD patients exhibit elevated lactate concentrations due to impaired glucose metabolism. Lactate serves as a substrate for a post-translational modification known as lactylation, which is integral to numerous cellular processes. The study aimed to explore the potential role of lactylation in DKD podocyte injury and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that lactate concentrations were elevated in the plasma of DKD patients, as well as in the serum and renal tissue of diabetic mice. High glucose (HG) resulted in increased lactate accumulation in podocytes, exacerbated podocyte injury and promoted protein lactylation. Protein modification omics demonstrated that LARS1 lactylation was enhanced, specifically at the K970 site, which further aggravated podocyte injury by inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis. In vivo transfection with LARS1 siRNA significantly improved renal function and mitigated podocyte injury. Our study identified a novel mechanism linking LARS1 lactylation activity to compromised podocyte autophagy, heightened podocyte injury, and the onset of proteinuria within DKD."

One approach is the use of preventive therapies to reduce cancer risk; dietary-derived compounds with good safety profiles represent a promising source of potential candidates but translating encouraging preclinical data to successful trials presents significant challenges. Development of curcumin, from the spice turmeric, as a preventive therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) is hindered by poor understanding of its mechanism of action. Using patient derived xenografts and ex-vivo 3D-models exposed to clinically achievable curcumin concentrations, we found that it targets proliferating cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) within premalignant adenoma and early-stage cancer tissues, with broad spectrum activity across all molecular subtypes. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that curcumin pushes CSCs towards differentiation over self-renewal, thereby inhibiting tumour development. Evidence suggests these effects involve direct protein binding of curcumin to NANOG, a master regulator of CRC CSCs, and impairment of its transcriptional activity via direct interference with NANOG-DNA binding. Furthermore, curcumin decreased the proportion of proliferating CSCs, defined by NANOG/Ki67 co-expression in patient derived explants and individuals with tumours containing a small fraction of these cells had greatly improved progression-free survival compared to those in the highest quartile for expression. The use of curcumin to minimise this cellular population may yield significant benefit and its clinical evaluation is warranted. Overall, this study provides crucial mechanistic insight, identifying patient populations likely to benefit from curcumin for prevention of sporadic CRC and theragnostic biomarkers for assessing efficacy."

This study aims to investigate whether the administration of IL-10 can suppress disease flares in ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\nMETHODS: A UC model was established in mice using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of IL-10. LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were utilized to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\n\nRESULTS: IL-10 administration significantly alleviated clinical symptoms in DSS-induced colitis, including promoting body weight recovery, increasing colon length, and reducing disease activity index scores. IL-10 repaired the intestinal mucosal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, Interferon-γ, and IL-1β), and modulating oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells, IL-10 protected against apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis of control and IL-10 knockout mice showed a significant upregulation of Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) after IL-10 knockout. In contrast, ISG15 expression was downregulated in the LPS + IL-10 group but upregulated in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that ISG15 is a target gene of IL-10 and plays a role in autophagy regulation. Furthermore, IL-10 enhanced autophagy by increasing the protein expression of ATG7, and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, thereby reducing apoptosis and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells. Autophagy inhibition with 3-Methyladenine or overexpression of ISG15 diminished IL-10's protective effects.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that IL-10 administration inhibits the progression of UC by activating autophagy and modulating ISG15 expression. In the future, targeted delivery of IL-10 to the intestinal lamina propria may enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects."

Keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and fibroblasts (CCD-986sk) were exposed to UVB (15 mJ/cm²) radiation or oxidative stress induced by 2 mM 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), followed by treatment with Arazyme (0.1-0.5 μM) for 24 h. The effects of Arazyme were compared to those of individual treatments with papain, trypsin, or retinol, which served as reference compounds. Key parameters examined included the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13), collagen synthesis, and cellular senescence markers (LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53). Additionally, the impact of Arazyme on cellular signaling pathways, including ERK, JNK, and NF-κB, was assessed. Arazyme significantly suppressed UVB-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells compared to other treatments. In UVB-exposed fibroblasts, Arazyme reduced both mRNA and protein levels of MMPs, while also enhancing procollagen concentration and collagen gene expression. Furthermore, Arazyme inhibited the activation of ERK, JNK, and NF-κB signaling pathways in keratinocytes. In AAPH-stimulated HaCaT cells, Arazyme significantly attenuated the expression of senescence-related markers, including LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53, and decreased the proportion of senescence-positive cells in fibroblasts. Our in vitro findings suggest that Arazyme may help attenuate UVB- and oxidative stress-induced markers of skin aging, indicating its potential as a candidate for further investigation in anti-aging skincare research."

The aim of this study was to assess the protective effect of Qiukui Taoren Recipe (QT), and the potential molecular mechanisms in AKI using network pharmacology prediction, in vivo and in vitro experiment. There were 42 active components of QT detected by HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, and network pharmacology showed that these active components mainly could act with 63 core targets such as TNF-α, Caspase-3, BCL2, STAT3, PPARγ, and regulated 110 signaling pathways for alleviating AKI. In addition, QT reduced periocular oedema, renal malformations and size reduction, partially restore renal excretory function, and reduced the accumulation of proteinuria in zebrafish AKI model induced by caristolochic acid (AA). QT could upregulate the mRNA expression of Nephrin and oxidative stress genes (Nrf2, HO-1, PPARγ), and downregulate inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, Caspase-3, P53). Furthermore, QT inhibited ROS elevation and apoptosis activated by cisplatin (CDDP) in HEK293T cells. Western blotting results showed that QT could enhance the protein expression of nephrin, and inhibited the protein expression of Kim-1, IL-18, NLRP3, STAT3, P53 and Caspase-3.

Although lactylation has garnered increasing attention, its role in TAD remains poorly understood.\n\nMETHODS: Lactylation-related genes (LRGs) were obtained from the MsigDB database. Lactylation-related hub genes (LRHGs) were identified by intersecting LRGs with differentially expressed genes and WGCNA results. Lactylation was assessed in a β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced mouse model and human aortic tissues. Two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from the GEO database were utilized to evaluate lactylation patterns across cell populations and intercellular communication networks. Biomarkers were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Elevated lactylation levels were observed in both TAD tissues and synthetic phenotype vascular smooth muscle cells. Through integrated analysis, we identified 12 LRHGs, which includes LDHA. In the BAPN-induced mouse model, LDHA inhibitors (Oxamate and FX11) significantly reduced mortality rates and decreased aortic lactate levels and protein lactylation. ScRNA-seq analytic results revealed that monocytes and macrophages exhibited the highest lactylation activity, which likely enhanced their inflammatory pathways and intercellular communication. ROC analysis showed the lowest AUC of 12 LRHGs is 0.8893.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the critical role of lactylation-related hub genes in TAD, identifying potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers, which provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TAD."

The neural and behavioral mechanisms for such primate-typical food preferences remain poorly understood, despite their importance for human health and their targeting by pharmacological obesity treatments. Here, we review a series of experiments that investigated how the biologically critical properties of foods-their nutrients (sugar, fat, protein) and oral-sensory qualities (viscosity, oral sliding friction)-influence food preferences in monkeys and humans. In an economic nutrient-choice paradigm, macaques flexibly trade nutrients and oral-sensory food qualities against varying food amounts, consistent with the assignment of subjective values. Nutrient-value functions that link objective nutrient content to subjective values accurately model these preferences, predict choices across contexts, and explain individual differences. The monkeys' aggregated choice patterns resulting from their nutrient preferences lead to daily nutrient balances that deviate from dietary reference points, resembling suboptimal human eating patterns when exposed to high-calorie foods. To investigate the sensory basis underlying nutrient values, we developed novel engineering tools that quantify food textures on oral surfaces, using fresh pig tongues. Oral-texture (i.e., mouthfeel) parameters, including viscosity and sliding friction, were shown to mediate monkeys' preferences for high-fat foods. When translated to human subjects, this approach revealed a neural mechanism for preferring high-fat foods from oral texture in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-a key reward system of the brain. Importantly, human OFC responses to oral sliding friction in individual subjects-measured in the MRI scanner-predicted subsequent fat intake in a naturalistic, life-like eating test. These findings suggest that a primate nutrient-reward paradigm offers a promising approach for investigating the behavioral and neural mechanisms for human-typical food reward and food choice, to advance understanding of human eating behavior, overeating, and obesity."

The diagnostic process for HVL is frequently hindered by the disease's nonspecific clinical presentation and the inherent limitations of existing serological assays, which often exhibit suboptimal sensitivity and specificity, predisposing to diagnostic inaccuracies. Developing of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays is crucial for effective HVL control in Brazil, enabling early disease detection and improving treatment outcomes. To enhance diagnostic capabilities, we evaluated the performance of a chimeric protein designed from B-lymphocyte cell epitopes identified through immunoproteomic analysis in serological tests for detecting L. infantum infection. Under the experimental conditions, the chimeric protein demonstrated the following diagnostic performance: 100 % specificity against control samples, 94.12 % specificity against Chagas disease samples, and 100 % sensitivity for HVL-positive individuals. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated the following performance metrics: area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9960, 100 % sensitivity, and 97.10 % overall specificity, significantly exceeding the performance of the L. infantum soluble antigen (SLiA) ELISA. These findings suggest that the chimeric protein represents a promising antigen for developing of improved HVL diagnostic technologies, potentially reducing the disease's public health impact."

Immunomodulatory approaches, including phosphodiesterase inhibition and cytokine regulation, demonstrate potential in optimizing host immune responses. Novel mechanisms such as ferroptosis inhibition and pyroptosis modulation present promising therapeutic avenues. The review also examines the role of established drugs being repurposed for TB treatment, including statins and antidepressants. While preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of various HDTs, the review emphasizes the need for careful consideration of host-pathogen interactions and potential immunological approaches. The complexity of TB pathophysiology necessitates a personalized approach to HDT implementation. Future research directions should focus on clinical validation, optimal dosing strategies, and combination approaches with standard antimicrobial therapy.

A PH mouse model was established using SU5416 combined with hypoxia (Su/Hy) in both wild-type and TOP2A knockout mice. Echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, and histological analyses were performed to assess pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular function. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were exposed to hypoxia to mimic PH in vitro. TOP2A and YTHDF1 were knocked down or overexpressed in PASMCs using shRNAs or overexpression plasmids. Cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy were evaluated using various biological assays. RIP and MeRIP assays were conducted to investigate the interaction between YTHDF1 and TOP2A mRNA. Data showed that TOP2A expression was significantly elevated in the lung tissues of Su/Hy-induced PH mice and hypoxia-exposed PASMCs. Functionally, TOP2A depletion in mice attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling, improved right ventricular function, reduced macrophage activation, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Similarly, in hypoxia-treated PASMCs, TOP2A silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and autophagy-related protein expression. Furthermore, elevated m6A levels and increased YTHDF1 expression were observed in PH models, and we found that YTHDF1 bound to m6A-modified TOP2A mRNA to enhance its translation. Additionally, YTHDF1 knockdown reduced TOP2A protein expression and mitigated hypoxia-induced PASMCs dysfunction, while TOP2A overexpression reversed these protective effects. Mechanistically, TOP2A activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, driving PASMCs proliferation and migration. Collectively, this study identifies YTHDF1-mediated m6A modification as a key regulator of TOP2A expression, which promotes PASMCs dysfunction and vascular remodeling in PH via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still has a high mortality rate and an increasing prevalence trend. Therefore, improving treatment methods is essential for the management of this cancer. Turmerones, which are the main volatile natural components of Curcuma longa Linn, have shown a number of beneficial biological activities both in vitro and in vivo. However, because of their hydrophobicity, their delivery methods need substantial improvement. Niosomes, which are made of non-ionic surfactants, have shown promising results in drug delivery systems (DDSs). Due to their appropriate encapsulation rate, stability, bioavailability, and predictable release patterns, they could be useful tools in DDSs. In this study, we demonstrated the benefit of treatment with turmerone-loaded niosomes on cancerous phenotypes of two HCC cell line in vitro and in vivo.\n\nMETHOD: Turmerone-loaded niosomes were synthesized through thin-film hydration method and characterized with dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The impact of turmerone-loaded niosomes on Huh-7 and Hep3B cells were assessed in vitro in term of gene expression, protein production, apoptosis, cell cycle, and some functional assessments such as colony formation potential and migration. Furthermore, tumorigenesis potential of the turmerone-loaded niosomes treated hepatoma cells was assessed in an in vivo model using nude mice.\n\nRESULTS: Our in vitro experiments showed that turmerone-loaded niosomes induced apoptosis (26.04 % for Huh-7 and 29.7 % for Hep3B) and cell cycle arrest in Huh-7 and Hep3B cells. Additionally, turmerone-loaded niosomes treatment down-regulated EMT-inducing genes and significantly decreased the EMT phenotype, as well as decreased colony formation capacity in both cell lines (surviving fraction of 0.27 for Huh-7 and 0.032 for Hep3B). In vivo study showed that upon transplantation, hepatoma cells which have been pre-treated with turmerone-loaded niosomes have less growth rate and produced smaller tumors with significantly few proliferating cells in nude mice.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that turmerone delivery through niosome have higher anti-cancer potentials in comparison to free-turmerone treatment on HCC cell line. Therefore, this approach could have a promising therapeutic potential in combination with other approved clinical settings for HCC treatment."

The samples were categorised into two groups based on pathological findings: SA (n = 27) and CA (n = 47). Metagenomic profiling was employed to characterized the microbial composition and function in both groups. Additionally, clinical parameters associated with the microbiota were analysed.\n\nRESULTS: The SA group exhibited higher levels of Burkholderia, Mycobacterium, and Klebsiella, while the CA group demonstrated higher levels of Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Tannerella. Additionaly, there were significant differences in clinical parameters, including C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), fibrinogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, complement C3, and chloride, between two groups. Furthermore, functional profiling revealed alterations in microbial metabolism and antibiotic resistance, highlighting the complex interplay between microbial communities and host inflammatory responses in appendicitis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identifies unique microbial and serum biomarkers and their correlates in varying severities of acute appendicitis, highlighting the role of the microbiome in the aetiology of acute appendicitis."

HPP's \"biochemical signature\" comprises low serum alkaline phosphatase activity together with elevated plasma levels of the TNSALP natural substrates phosphoethanolamine (PEA), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Excess extracellular PPi (ePPi) inhibits mineralization and affected children prematurely shed deciduous teeth and often suffer weakness and rickets. Yet, HPP severity is greatest among all dento-osseous disorders and not fully explained by autosomal dominant versus autosomal recessive inheritance involving >470 ALPL mutations. Discordance of HPP phenotype sometimes manifests even among full siblings sharing an identical ALPL genotype. Herein, a girl's markedly discordant HPP featured at presentation life-threatening hypercalcemia, failure-to-thrive, and renal compromise. Subsequent pseudotumor cerebri syndrome caused blindness, and then craniosynostosis required cranial vault reconstruction. However, she was not deformed, had moderate hypophosphatasemia, normal plasma PLP level, and mild radiographic features of HPP rickets. Elevated plasma N-terminal parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) suggested malignancy, but corrected after kidney transplantation. HPP was diagnosed when whole exome sequencing revealed heterozygous ALPL c.1034C>T, p.A345V found in mild pediatric HPP and transmitted by her mother who considered herself well. Genes conditioning ePPi formation and underlying other skeletal diseases were intact. Hypercalcemia, unresponsive to bone antiresorptive drugs, corrected promptly with asfotase alfa TNSALP supplementation therapy. Her markedly discordant findings highlight genotype/phenotype plasticity for pediatric HPP, and her clinical course importance for early diagnosis."

The metabolite profiles of mature human milk (MHM) have been reported to be affected by maternal physiological conditions, lactation stage, and maternal diets. We collected MHM (3-6 months postpartum) from 32 healthy mothers with different parities and delivery modes. Then, GC-MS and LC-MS were used to perform an untargeted metabolomic study. A clear distinction can be observed in terms of MHM metabolites of mothers with different delivery modes and parities with a 95% confidence interval. A total of 119 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified in MHM of women with different delivery modes. Metabolic pathway analyses indicated that these DEMs were mainly associated with fatty acid biosynthesis. The higher abundances of these DEMs in MHM of cesarean women may be due to the differing levels of cortisol and oxytocin between mothers with different delivery modes. Meanwhile, 284 DEMs were identified in MHM of women with different parities. These DEMs were primarily related to ABC transporters, center carbon metabolism in cancer, and D-amino acid metabolism. These findings highlighted the impact of delivery mode and parity on HM metabolite composition. Further research is needed to explore the long-term health implications of these metabolic differences and optimize infant nutrition strategies."

The chimera was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and demonstrated strong antigenicity, effectively recognizing sera from hamsters infected with diverse Leptospira serovars, indicating its non-serovar-specific nature (P < 0.001). ELISA assays were conducted using 80 human sera previously characterized by MAT. In the acute phase, IgM detection achieved 95 % of sensitivity and specificity (cut-off = 0.15, AUC = 0.990; P < 0.001). In the convalescent phase, IgG detection showed 80 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity (cut-off = 0.16, AUC = 0.968; P < 0.001). When the unknown disease phase were assessed, both IgG and IgM ELISAs maintained high diagnostic performance, with sensitivities and specificities ≥95 % and AUC values above 0.98. These findings highlight the ErpY-LemA chimera as a promising antigen for the development of a rapid, cost-effective serological diagnostic test for human leptospirosis, with high sensitivity and specificity regardless of disease stage or infecting serovar."

The MTS-hydrogel platform was subjected to PEFs varying in pulse width and electric field (EF) strength. Treated MTS were monitored and evaluated for viability and proliferation (Live/Dead imaging, XTT Cell Viability Assay), and migration (brightfield imaging) over 5 days post-treatment. In vitro experimentation was validated with a multi-layered spheroid finite element model, evaluating transmembrane potential (TMP), pore density, and pore formation across the spheroid layers. MTS exposed to longer pulse widths (5, 100 μs) and higher EFs (2000, 2500 V/cm) experienced a complete ablation. Smaller pulse widths and lower EFs produced partial ablations initially reducing the MTS, but unable to prevent the MTS from recuperating. Similarly shown with the computational model, a TMP was accomplished through the MTS, inducing electroporation; however, pore formation was dictated by the increase in pulse width and EF beyond the superficial layer. EFs of 2000 V/cm and above severely constrained the migration independent of pulse width."

    "text": "Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) prediction plays a crucial role in the drug discovery process by evaluating the strength of the interaction between a drug and its biological target, which is often a protein. Despite advancements in DTA prediction through deep learning, several fundamental challenges persist: (i) suboptimal information propagation in molecular graphs, limiting the effective representation of complex drug structures, (ii) accurately modeling the complex interactions between drug-binding sites and protein substructures, and (iii) prioritizing critical substructure interactions to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. To address these challenges, the DICCA-DTA framework is introduced, aiming to improve the contextual integration of molecular information and facilitate a more comprehensive representation of drug-target interactions in allopathic research. It employs a Diffused Isomorphic Network (DIN) to extract comprehensive drug features from molecular graphs, capturing both local substructures and global information. Furthermore, a Contextualized Capsule Attention Network (CCAN) module incorporates multi-head attention with capsule networks to capture both local and global protein sequence characteristics. The attention-guided Factorized Cross-Pooling (FCP) mechanism dynamically refines drug-protein interaction modeling by selectively emphasizing critical binding site interactions, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. Explainable attention maps further reveal the most crucial drug-protein binding site interactions, providing transparent insights into the model's decision-making process. Comprehensive evaluations across the Davis, KIBA, Metz and BindingDB datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the DICCA-DTA framework over existing state-of-the-art models. A case study on cancer-related protein interactions from the DrugBank database further demonstrates the framework's precision in identifying key drug-protein affinities, reinforcing its potential to accelerate drug discovery and repurposing."

    "text": "Pathway enrichment analysis is a valuable tool for researchers aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying any specific drug or disease associated gene lists derived from biological assays or large-scale genome (omics) experiments. By employing this method, researchers can pinpoint biological pathways that exhibit a higher level of enrichment for a given set of genes than would be anticipated by random chance. These biological pathways play a crucial role in understanding the disease pathophysiology, therapeutic strategy, polypharmacological effects, synergistic mechanisms, and target engagement. However many of the available tools do not fulfill this requirement as most of the available tools consider a flat hierarchy of protein involvement in the pathway and do not consider topological information or importance of molecules in the pathway. Here we propose a novel method to enrich the molecular pathways and prioritize them based on their importance and crucial role in the biological function using the graph and evidence-based approach and customized datasets called PathwayMind. It includes 2648 pathways, 4539 biological events, 2465847 protein-protein interactions and 124717 gene-to-pathway relationships and the role of 3510 unique initial genes in 11,992 molecular pathways. The current manuscript comprises three major steps: The first step is about the data extraction and datasets creation for pathway enrichment, and the second steps comprises pathway perturbation analysis to identify most perturbed biological pathways and the third steps includes validation of this approach along with standalone tools and visualization algorithms which disclose the molecular involvement and improve the interpretability of the results. The end-to-end pathway analysis can be performed in a few minutes to provide complete insights of your target or drug of interest. The current PathwayMind tool and its datasets could be very useful for the molecular scientists and system biologists who are interested to understand the therapeutic effects of their drugs or understanding the involvement of biological pathways for specific gene sets which does not require any prior bioinformatics training."

Recent deep learning-based DTI predictions have demonstrated promising performance, but they still face two challenges: (i) The over-reliance on the extraction of local features and insufficient learning of global features limit the model's performance. (ii) The lack of effective fusion of drug-target interaction features leads to the lack of interpretability of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for predicting drug-target interactions based on multi-order gated convolution and multi-attention fusion, MGMA-DTI. The drug feature encoder obtains a two-dimensional molecular graph based on the drug's SMILES string and uses a graph convolutional neural network to encode the drug features. The protein encoder is based on a multi-order gated convolution, which enhances the model's ability to capture global feature between amino acid sequences. In order to better achieve interactive learning between drugs and proteins, we designed a multi-attention fusion module that effectively captures the drug-target interaction features. Experimental results show that MGMA-DTI outperforms other baseline models on three benchmark datasets: BindingDB, BioSNAP, and Human. Case studies further demonstrate that the model provides valuable insights for drug discovery. In addition, our model provides molecular-level interpretability, which can provide more scientifically meaningful guidance."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) exhibit inherently efficient delivery to the liver and can be engineered to carry various therapeutic substances, making them promising agents. In this study, EVs were engineered to display fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on their surface and encapsulate miR-223 (223/F-EVs), aiming to improve steatosis and alleviate inflammation and fibrosis, respectively. Introducing the 223/F-EVs into human liver cell lines significantly reduced both basal and induced levels of lipid storage, inflammation, and fibrosis markers. Furthermore, using an FGF21-blocking antibody or miR-223 inhibitor effectively diminished the efficacy of the 223/F-EVs, confirming the essential roles of FGF21 and miR-223 in these processes. In a Choline-Deficient, l-Amino acid-defined, High-Fat Diet (CDAHFD)-fed mouse model, intravenously administered 223/F-EVs demonstrated liver-preferential delivery and a marked reduction in the MASH phenotype without compromising bone density, unlike conventional FGF21 treatment. Collectively, 223/F-EVs convey FGF21 and miR-223 exclusively to the liver, offering strategic advantages by mitigating MASH progression via multiple pathways. This study lays a solid foundation for further investigation of engineered EVs as a transformative therapeutic approach for treating MASH."

A common form of CKD is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the most inherited genetic kidney disease and affects greater than 12.5 million individuals globally. Given that there are over 400 pathogenic PKD1/PKD2 mutations in patients with ADPKD, relying solely on small molecule drugs targeting a single signaling pathway has not been effective in treating ADPKD. Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are naturally released by cells from the kidneys and the urinary tract, and uEVs isolated from non-disease sources have been reported to carry functional polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), the respective products of PKD1 and PKD2 genes that are mutated in ADPKD. uEVs from non-disease sources, as a result, have the potential to provide a direct solution to the root of the disease by delivering functional proteins that are mutated in ADPKD. To test our hypothesis, we first isolated uEVs from healthy mice urine and conducted a comprehensive characterization of uEVs. Then, PC1 levels and EV markers CD63 and TSG101 of uEVs were confirmed via ELISA and Western blot. Following characterization of uEVs, the in vitro cellular uptake, inhibition of cyst growth, and gene rescue ability of uEVs were demonstrated in kidney cells.

Results showed that SDF at a low ratio (≤ 3.5) induced a compact matrix structure, which decreased protein digestibility to 67.70 % and total amino acids release to 140.67 mg/g protein, respectively. The compaction of the noodle matrix could be attributed to the promotion of cross-linking between D-type low molecular weight gluten and γ-gliadin by a small amount of SDF, reducing lacunarity from 0.28 to 0.16. A high SDF ratio (>3.5) induced a more fragmented matrix structure, increasing protein digestibility to 76.88 %. Notably, at a higher SDF ratio (>4.5), the concentration-dependent static quenching on enzymatic sites of SDF became prominent, slightly reducing gastric protein digestibility. In summary, an SDF ratio of 2.0-2.5 helps to reduce the inhibition of SDF on protein digestion."

At the salivary level, MPs formed a dense network with artificial saliva (AS) through key hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that the primary interaction force between CECA and AS were electrostatic interaction. However, as the concentration of CECA increased, the stacking of polysaccharide chains enhanced the exposure of protein components, thereby promoting additional hydrophobic interactions with AS. In contrast, the rigid triple-helical structure of 2082 facilitated greater exposure of its protein components, leading to predominant hydrophobic interactions with AS. Texture analysis demonstrated that MPs formed an adhesive layer on the tongue surface. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MPs inhibited the activation of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 by MOPC through two mechanisms: reducing binding sites and blocking receptor activation. These findings provided practical applications for improving the taste of wine and offered a theoretical foundation for modulating undesirable tastes in other beverage systems."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Whole blood sample consists of red and white blood cells, platelets, nucleic acids, proteins, and other metabolites. However, the presence of blood cells will affect the monitoring of biomarker in plasma. To obtain plasma from microscale whole blood, plasma separation membranes are commonly used. However, obtaining high-purity plasma within a short time in point-of-care cases still remains a significant challenge. It is evident that achieving high yield/purity and high recovery rate of markers plasma separation from microliters of whole blood in an extremely short time is crucial for the point-of-care (POC) testing.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we propose dual-gradient (structural\\wetting gradient) plasma separation membranes (DG-PSMs) to effectively address the above issue. Specifically, the upper layer of DG-PSM pre-treated by blood-typing antibody exhibits hydrophobicity, which can promote red blood cell (RBC) agglutination reaction. In addition, the wetting gradient can generate wetting gradient force, which also facilitates the rapid transport of plasma. As a result, the DG-PSM can extract extremely pure plasma (∼99.99 %) from ∼15 μL whole blood. More importantly, the plasma separation costs only 15 s, far less than that of other traditional plasma separation membranes (e.g., 5-10 min). The flash separation process reduces the possibility of entanglement/absorption of protein by paper fibers, achieving an ultra-high protein recovery rate (∼98.88 %). In addition, the DG-PSM is comparable to centrifugation in avoiding hemolysis of RBCs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the plasma separated by DG-PSM was tested for blood glucose detection by integrating microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) and colorimetric assays, which achieved rapid blood glucose detection (∼20 s). The DG-PSM promotes the realization of plasma separation and detection on lab-on-a-chip. We believe DG-PSM can be integrated into more detection devices to benefit mankind in remote areas and developing countries."

However, current delivery methods are either invasive or inefficient due to low bioavailability. Therefore, an alternative route of administration is needed. Pulmonary delivery is a promising option as it can provide high bioavailability and a rapid onset of action. Beyond systemic analgesia, NAL has also shown local therapeutic benefits in the lungs. This study aimed to develop inhalable NAL powders using spray drying, with leucine and human serum albumin (HSA) as dispersion enhancers. The resulting powders were amorphous and contained <4 % residual solvent by mass. The spray dried particles were spherical, 3-4 µm large, and exhibited corrugated surface. Spray dried NAL alone were inhalable, with a fine particle fraction <5 µm (FPF) at 25 %. The addition of HSA improved the FPF to 33 % and 37 % for 10 % and 20 % w/w HSA, respectively. Similarly, the FPF increased to 39 % after adding 10 % w/w leucine, reaching a maximum of 47 % with 20 % w/w leucine. The latter formulation also demonstrated good chemical and physical stability after one month of storage at 25 °C under both 30 % and 60 % relative humidity. These formulations can be used as a platform to deliver NAL and other opioid analgesics by inhalation."

This research aims to assess the expression of EDIL3 in PH and to investigate its underlying mechanisms in the condition. Our results indicated that EDIL3 levels are elevated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), as well as in hypoxia-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) compared to normoxia-treated controls. Additionally, a mouse model of PH induced by SU5416 along with hypoxia (Su/Hx) also expressed elevated EDIL3 levels. We discovered that EDIL3 knockdown diminished the proliferation and migration of PASMCs. Mechanically, we identified an interaction between EDIL3 and integrin αVβ3. The regulation of PASMCs proliferation by EDIL3 was disrupted by cilengitide, an RGD pentapeptide that serves as a potent and selective inhibitor of integrin αVβ3. Furthermore, recombinant EDIL3 significantly increased the level of p-ERK1/2, an effect that was blocked by cilengitide, while p-p38 and p-JNK levels remained unchanged. In summary, our study introduces a novel therapeutic strategy for treating PAH and highlights a new serum biomarker for its diagnosis."

Three month outcomes were scored according to a pediatric post-encephalitis scale; clinical features focussed on new onset symptoms during the follow-up, blinded to antibody results. Ten/34 children (29 %) had serum antibodies against known neuronal-surface antigens, 4 NMDAR, 4 CASPR2, 1 GABAAR and 1 LGI1, detected from day 23 after onset. In addition, 8/10 (80 %) of these children and 13/24 (54 %) others had antibodies that bound in a distinctive pattern to live hippocampal neurons (HN-Abs), four detected on days 9-12. A relapse was only considered possible in 5 patients, two with specific neuronal surface antibodies (NSAbs). Neither specific NSAbs (p = 1.00) nor HN-Abs (p = 1.00).were more common in patients with possible relapse than in those with unlikely relapse. There was a modest trend towards worse outcome scores in patients with known NSAbs than in the remaining patients (p = 0.089). Antibodies to neuronal surface proteins, known and unknown, are common in children after JE. Caution is urged in defining post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis on the basis of a positive neuronal antibody and new onset symptoms or deterioration following recovery from JE, or in initiating immunotherapy without confirmatory evidence of a time-dependent encephalitic illness defined by published guidelines."

Thecysteamine (AET) pathway is one of the primary metabolic routes involved in taurine biosynthesis, and its role in mollusk taurine synthesis has garnered increasing recognition. In the present study, a cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) homolog CgADO, the central enzyme of the AET pathway, was identified in C. gigas, which contained a typical PCO_ADO domain. The transcripts of CgADO were constitutively expressed in examined oyster tissues, with the highest level detected in the adductor muscle while the lowest in the hepatopancreas. The recombinant CgADO protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, was capable of converting cysteamine to hypotaurine. Overexpression of CgADO in HEK293T cells increased the production of taurine by 20.31-fold, compared to cells transfected with the empty vector. Inhibition of endogenous CgADO expression using RNA interference resulted in a 49% reduction in its mRNA expression and an 8% decline in taurine content in the adductor muscle of oysters. These results indicated that CgADO functioned as a cysteamine dioxygenase and played a certain role in taurine biosynthesis in C. gigas."

However, the therapeutic efficacy of CBD is limited by extensive hepatic metabolism and low oral bioavailability (approximately 20 %). These problems can be overcome by choosing an appropriate targeted drug delivery system. Delivering CBD to the lungs via a dry powder formulation could be an effective method to achieve adequate concentration and therapeutic efficacy. This study aims to develop a dry powder formulation of CBD with Inulin (INU) and L-leucine (LEC) using spray drying and to characterize its physicochemical and aerodynamic properties. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to optimize the formulation by varying feed concentration (0.2 % w/v to 0.8 % w/v), LEC concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w), and CBD concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w). The resulting CBD dry powder formulations exhibited a wrinkled morphology with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 5 µm and displayed a crystalline structure, as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. The response surface method (RSM) showed that increasing the feed concentration correlated with higher yields of the CBD formulations. Specifically, the formulation with a feed concentration of 0.8 % w/v achieved a yield of 61 %. The aerosolization data demonstrated a direct relationship between the Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) and LEC concentration, indicating that FPF increases as the LEC concentration increases. The highest FPF of 62 % was achieved with a 20 % w/w LEC concentration and a feed concentration of 0.2 % w/v. Based on this, LEC plays a crucial role in enhancing aerosolization efficiency. While feed concentration negatively affects FPF, lower feed concentrations lead to an increase in FPF. The Fine Particle Dose (FPD) varied with the concentration of CBD, with higher concentrations resulting in a higher FPD. A 28 days stability study under different humidity conditions (<15 % and 53 %) confirmed the stability of the CBD formulations.

This property renders them particularly suitable for the delivery of biologics - large, structurally complex, and often unstable therapeutic agents such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, vaccines, and live cells or microorganisms. MNs offer a painless, self-administrable, and user-friendly alternative to conventional parenteral routes that often require trained personnel, generate hazardous waste, and result in low patient compliance. Since their first description in the 1990s, a wide variety of MN systems have been developed including solid, hollow, coated, dissolving, and hydrogel-forming, each with distinct fabrication and formulation requirements. This review provides a detailed and comparative discussion on formulation strategies tailored for the efficient delivery of different classes of biologics using MNs, with emphasis on the physicochemical and biological interactions at the skin interface. Special attention is given to sterilization, an often-overlooked yet regulatory-critical aspect, highlighting its importance for product safety, bioburden control, and biologic stability. Both terminal sterilization methods and aseptic manufacturing approaches are reviewed along with emerging alternatives such as self-sterilizing MNs. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of biologic-loaded MNs currently undergoing clinical evaluation. While previous reviews have focused on materials or fabrication aspects, this article presents a formulation-centric analysis, integrating physicochemical considerations, delivery challenges, and clinical translation pathways. The goal is to provide formulation scientists and translational researchers with a practical guide to MN-enabled biologic delivery systems, from bench to bedside."

PA and depressive symptoms were assessed using self-report scales. The WCS was calculated by subtracting self-reported average weekday sleep hours from weekend sleep hours, and serum hsCRP levels were measured using immunoturbidimetric methods. Given that depressive symptoms are characterized by their multifaceted nature, we identified specific symptoms associated with hsCRP levels. Path analysis was used to investigate the association between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and depressive symptoms, and that between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and specific symptoms related to hsCRP.\n\nRESULTS: Higher levels of PA and WCS were associated with a decreased risk of depressive symptoms through lowering hsCRP levels. Among various depressive symptoms, sleep problems and appetite changes were associated with hsCRP. In pathway analyses using them as dependent variables, higher levels of PA and WCS were also associated with a decreased risk of sleep problems and appetite changes through lowering hsCRP levels.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The current study employed a cross-sectional design, and WCS and PA were based on participants' self-reports rather than objective measurements.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of PA and WCS may help alleviate depressive symptoms, particularly sleep problems and appetite changes, by mitigating chronic inflammation. Therefore, ensuring adequate exercise time and compensating for inadequate weekday sleep during weekends are crucial for maintaining mental well-being."

However, their practical utilization is hindered by challenges such as high production costs and environmental sensitivity, particularly in relation to pH, temperature, and light, which can affect their structural stability and functional performance. This review summarizes traditional and innovative extraction techniques, discusses the structure-function relationships of these microalgal components, and highlights their potential applications. Furthermore, it identifies key production and commercialization challenges, proposing strategies to enhance extraction efficiency and environmental stability during processing and storage, thereby facilitating broader industrial implementation."

In this study, LCA-loaded casein-pectin nanoparticles (LCA-CS-P) were prepared using a pH-driven method to improve the release mechanism, and oral bioavailability of LCA. The results showed that the particle size, ζ-potential, polymer dispersity index, encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of LCA-CS-P were 228 ± 3.56 nm, -32.5 ± 0.62 mV, 0.23 ± 0.02, 88.6 ± 1.12 %, and 22.5 ± 0.92 % respectively. Gastrointestinal digestion dynamically modulates the hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions within nanoparticles. This pH-responsive interaction reconfiguration governs their gastric stability, intestinal release, and increased bioavailability (2.47-fold AUC increase vs. free LCA). In addition, LCA-CS-P not only significantly increased the content of LCA in various tissues, but also had gastric targeting. Therefore, LCA-CS-P nanoparticles are a viable strategy to improve the oral bioavailability of LCA and other active ingredients."

The assays employ a sandwich-format design in which nanobodies replace traditional antibodies, providing high stability and low background interference. Clinical evaluation demonstrated that NMP22 detection achieved 81.8 % sensitivity and 90.9 % specificity, while survivin detection yielded 72.7 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Both assays showed no significant differences compared to commercial ELISA kits (p > 0.05). Notably, multiplex detection using both strips achieved 100.0 % sensitivity and 90.9 % specificity, demonstrating superior performance compared to single-biomarker approaches.

Despite its benefits, PEGylated proteins are often heterogeneous mixtures containing positional isoforms that are challenging to eliminate and can significantly impact the biological activity of drugs. This study developed a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the separation and quantification of positional isoforms in commercial PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) at the peptide level. In this strategy, PEG-rhGH was digested into peptides via trypsin treatment and then separated and quantified using RP-UPLC. Under the chromatography condition optimized from Quality by Design (QbD) principles, this method can effectively distinguish the PEGylated peptides in five isomers. MALDI-TOF MS, SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation indicated that each of these five isomers was conjugated with one 40 kDa branched PEG at a specific lysine residue and the N-terminal. Through the concentration correction of PEGylated peptides varying in sequence lengths, the proportion of five modified sites can be quantified. The comparative assay showed that this strategy effectively addresses the limitations of the commonly used IEC method, especially under challenging conditions like post-translational modifications (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, and cyclization) and conformational changes. As a result, it offers improved robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed RP-UPLC method exhibited outstanding repeatability across various storage conditions, making it a reliable tool for quality control and product release in the biopharmaceutical industry."

Early detection and targeted therapy depend on identifying key molecular biomarkers that drive tumor progression. The molecular heterogeneity of COAD demands robust computational strategies to improve the accuracy of biomarker discovery.\n\nMETHODS: We developed and implemented a comprehensive, multi-step bioinformatics and statistical pipeline to systematically prioritize clinically relevant biomarkers in COAD. This pipeline integrated differential gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and functional enrichment analysis to identify key hub genes associated with tumor progression. We subsequently applied principal component analysis (PCA) and overall survival modeling to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of these candidates. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess their sensitivity and specificity. Finally, experimental validation of the prioritized hub genes was conducted via qPCR across three CRC cell lines (LoVo, HCT-116, and HT-29), confirming their upregulation and supporting their clinical potential.\n\nRESULTS: Our integrative pipeline prioritized five key hub genes (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) as significantly upregulated in COAD tissues compared to normal controls. Functional enrichment analysis linked these genes to extracellular matrix degradation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammatory signaling, and tumor invasion, underscoring their roles in key oncogenic processes. Survival analysis revealed varying degrees of association with patient prognosis, most notably for CXCL1. Diagnostic performance, assessed by ROC analysis, yielded moderate AUC values (0.669-0.692), supporting their potential as biomarkers. Finally, qPCR validation across three CRC cell lines confirmed robust upregulation of all five genes, reinforcing their biological relevance in COAD progression.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study establishes a reproducible, integrative bioinformatics and statistical framework for the systematic identification of clinically actionable biomarkers in CRC. The five hub genes prioritized (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) demonstrated consistent diagnostic and prognostic value, offering a solid basis for the development of non-invasive molecular diagnostics and contributing to precision oncology."

We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal relationships between insulin use and PND. The forward MR analysis revealed that insulin use considerably reduced the risk of delirium (odds ratio [OR] = 0.01, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.0007-0.22, P = 0.003) and enhanced cognitive performance (OR = 8.03, 95 % CI: 2.83-22.78, P = 0.001). Importantly, the reverse MR analysis indicated that cognitive impairment or delirium did not causally affect insulin use (OR ≈ 1.0, P > 0.5). Utilizing GEO datasets, we identified 63 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to both postoperative delirium and insulin treatment. Subsequent analyses, including the construction of a protein-protein interaction network and Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses, identified EPN2, DNAJC6, ARFGAP1, and HIP1R as key hub genes that could serve as potential therapeutic targets for PND. Further research showed that these hub genes are part of a multi-pathway interactive network, which may significantly contribute to the onset and progression of PND, with insulin also affecting their regulation. Our results establish a unidirectional genetic causality for the therapeutic effects of insulin in PND and reveal new molecular targets, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind insulin treatment for PND."

Moreover, an in vivo atherosclerosis model was established by tail vein injection of AAV8-PCSK9 virus into mice who were then fed a high-fat diet. EGR3 expression was manipulated through cellular lentiviral transfection and conditional gene knockout in mice. Oil red O staining was used to assess lipid droplet and mouse aortic plaque formation. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes in mouse aortic tissue. To quantify C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ELISA was conducted on HCAEC lysates and mouse serum samples. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine EGR3 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) protein levels and in both cellular lysates and mouse aortic tissue.\n\nRESULTS: In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that EGR3 expression was elevated in the ox-LDL group. Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that the CRP and VCAM-1 expression levels were significantly reduced and that lipid droplet formation was inhibited by EGR3 inhibition. Consistently, CRP, VCAM-1, blood glucose and lipid levels, and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions in mice were significantly reduced in Egr3 knockout mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that atherosclerosis development appears to be associated with the regulation of CRP and VCAM expression by EGR3.

Building on this rationale, this study presents a series of six D-(+)-biotin-conjugated squaraine dyes derived from benzothiazole, indolenine, and benz[e]indole, with N-ethyl and N-hexyl chains. These compounds were thoroughly characterized in terms of their photophysical and photochemical properties, revealing strong absorption in the so-called \"phototherapeutic window\", notable fluorescence, especially the benzothiazole derivatives, aqueous stability, particularly the indolenine-based dyes, and moderate to high photostability. Computational studies further indicated a strong binding affinity to human serum albumin and avidin proteins. All dyes exhibited photodynamic activity, with indolenine derivatives showing remarkable tumor selectivity and benz[e]indole analogs evidencing superior photocytotoxicity. The most promising compounds preferentially accumulated in mitochondria, and both singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species were found to play a role in their photobiological effects. Additionally, they were non-genotoxic in the absence of irradiation, and apoptosis was the primary mechanism of cell death upon light activation. This was evidenced by preserved cytoplasmic membrane integrity, nuclear fragmentation, and caspase-3/7 activation, reinforcing the safety and potential of these compounds as phototherapeutic agents. Although cellular uptake via the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter was not established, and diffusion is expected to be the predominant mechanism, the high predicted avidin-binding affinity of these dyes opens exciting new avenues for photodynamic therapy-combined strategies."

The frequent coexistence of LATE-NC with other neuropathologies, particularly Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and Lewy body dementia (LBD), exacerbates dementia severity and complicates diagnosis and treatment. Recent efforts have established clinical criteria for in-vivo diagnosis, including neuroimaging markers like hippocampal atrophy and limbic hypometabolism. Genetic studies have identified key risk genes, including GRN, TMEM106B, SORL1, and APOE, while biomarker development in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood remains in its early stages.\n\nSUMMARY: The review highlights the importance of multidisciplinary research and clinical approaches in addressing the complexities of neurodegenerative diseases involving TDP-43 proteinopathy, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and developing effective treatments tailored to individual patient profiles."

Angiogenesis plays a critical role in neurological recovery during cerebral ischemia. Rosavin is the main active ingredient of Rhodiola rosea for ischemic stroke treatment.\n\nPURPOSE: The study investigates the neuroprotective effects of Rosavin on ischemic stroke rats through activating HIF-1α signaling.\n\nMETHODS: In vivo studies, MCAO/IR model was employed and treatment with Rosavin, and the concentration of Rosavin in brain tissue was determined using LC-MS/MS at different time points. After 7 days of treatment, mNSS were used to assess the degree of neurological deficits in rats for evaluating the neuroprotective effects of Rosavin. MRI was used to measure cerebral infarct volume, and the Morris water maze was employed to evaluate spatial learning and memory abilities. IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR, NeuN, Bax and Bcl-2 was detected by Western blotting. In vitro studies, the effects of Rosavin on angiogenesis were assessed using OGD/R-induced HUVEC model. Moreover, Network pharmacology was used to predict the potential mechanisms of Rosavin. To investigate Rosavin protects against MCAO/IR-induced neurological damage via HIF-1α signaling, rats were treated with the HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1. After 7 days, Western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression levels of NeuN, HIF-1α, VEGFA, and EPO in the ischemic cortical brain tissue. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to evaluate the expression of HIF-1α, VEGFA, CD31, and NeuN.\n\nRESULTS: Rosavin (ip.) was detectable in the rat brain, with peak concentration achieved at 20 min post-administration. Rosavin significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume and mNSS scores in MCAO/IR rats. Additionally, Rosavin decreased the escape latency and increased the number of platform crossings in the Morris water maze test. In ischemic brain tissue, Rosavin reduced the number of apoptotic cells and Bax expression while increasing Bcl-2, NeuN, and CD31. Network pharmacology analysis identified 174 potential therapeutic targets of Rosavin for ischemic stroke, with enrichment analysis suggesting that it activated HIF-1α signaling. Rosavin upregulated HIF-1α protein and nuclear localization, and VEGF and EPO in the ischemic cortical brain tissue. In vitro studies showed that Rosavin inhibited OGD/R-induced tube formation in HUVECs and increased CD31, VEGFA, and EPO. These effects of Rosavin were abolished by HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1. Rosavin's interaction with the VHL protein instead of PHD2. Expression of HIF-1α and CD31 increased by Rosavin, which were failed after siVHL.\n\nCONCLUSION: Rosavin can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, improve neurological deficits, reduce cerebral infarct volume, and enhance spatial learning and memory abilities in MCAO/IR rats, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects. The underlying mechanism involves stabilizing HIF-1α protein through inhibiting VHL, increasing its nuclear translocation, which upregulates the expression of its target genes VEGF and EPO."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: Immunoglobulin D (IgD) myeloma is a rare subtype of multiple myeloma (MM), comprising approximately 1 %-2 % of all MM cases. Owing to the diminished levels of IgD in serum, IgD MM manifests as subtle M protein spikes in routine serum electrophoresis, rendering it susceptible to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning (ML) model utilizing readily available complete blood count and biochemical test data for the purpose of screening IgD MM.\n\nMETHODS: This study encompassed clinical data from 83 newly diagnosed IgD MM patients and 166 non-IgD MM patients, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithms were employed for model construction. The predictive performance of the ML models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve analysis, and decision curve analysis.\n\nRESULTS: The random forest-based screening model demonstrated superior performance, incorporating seven key features: LDH, albumin, creatinine, Ca, β2 microglobulin, age and Hb. It achieved an AUC of 0.954 (95 % CI 0.930-0.977), with a sensitivity of 0.958, specificity of 0.747, positive predictive value of 88.3 % and negative predictive value of 89.9 %. Furthermore, this model has been evaluated in the validation cohort.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The model constructed based on the random forest algorithm demonstrates potential in screening IgD MM patients, particularly when routine IgD immunotyping testing is not conducted in clinical practice. This can assist clinicians in early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies, thereby optimizing the utilization of medical resources."

However, the specific impact of lupenone on colon cancer has not been fully elucidated.\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to explore the anti-cancer effects of lupenone monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy agents in colon cancer.\n\nMETHOD: In vitro study, the cytotoxic effects of lupenone on CT26 and MC38 colon cancer cells were examined using CCK8 assay and colony formation assay. The anti-proliferation properties of lupenone were assessed via Ki67 staining, while cell apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry. The anti-migratory effects of lupenone were also detected using scratch wound healing assay and transwell assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways were measured using live-cell probes and real-time PCR, respectively. Autophagy and autophagy flux were evaluated through western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. In vivo experiment, the anti-tumor effects of lupenone, both as a monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin, were further examined in a CT26 tumor-bearing mouse model. Tumor volume and protein expression were used to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy, while histological staining assessed the safety of lupenone. RNA sequencing was performed to clarify the mechanisms of the combination of lupenone and cisplatin.\n\nRESULTS: Lupenone significantly inhibited the growth of CT26 and MC38 colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, reducing cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis. lupenone increased ROS levels and induced ROS-dependent ER stress in colon cancer cells. Additionally, lupenone triggered autophagy and inhibited autophagy flux, exerting anti-colon cancer effects that were attenuated by the autophagy inhibitor 3MA. Molecular docking revealed that lupenone has the potential to bind to mTOR, and the mTOR activator MHY1485 partially reversed lupenone-induced autophagy. Additionally, the scavenging of ROS and the inhibition of ER stress partially reversed the autophagic effects of lupenone. In vivo studies revealed that lupenone suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth without causing significant weight loss or damage to major organs. The combination therapy with lupenone and cisplatin enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, with RNA sequencing analyses indicating regulation of cancer cell metabolism, T cell differentiation and activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and the immune-inflammatory microenvironment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated lupenone monotherapy inhibited the growth of colon canceris and was non-toxic to major organs, while the combination of lupenone and chemotherapy drug could enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of chemotherapy drug. These findings highlight the potential of lupenone as a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of colon cancer."

However, the underlying mechanism related to renal fibrosis remains not fully understood.\n\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the protective effects and mechanism of FPS against renal fibrosis with a focus on gut-kidney axis.\n\nMETHODS: We established renal fibrosis models in mice using unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), folic acid (FA) challenge, or a microbiota-depleted, with continuous oral administration of FPS, Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), or acetate at specified doses and intervals. Simultaneously, we examined the impact of FPS on epithelial mesenchymal transformation in cultured HK-2 and investigated the associated mechanisms.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that fucoidan administration reduces renal collagen deposition, inflammation, epithelial mesenchymal transformation and improves renal function in mouse models of renal fibrosis induced by UUO or FA. Metagenomics analysis showed that fucoidan significantly increases the abundance of AKK by promoting its growth in UUO-induced renal fibrosis. Oral administration of live AKK alleviates renal fibrosis in UUO and FA mouse models. Using oral antibiotic-treated mice, we found that the effect of fucoidan on renal fibrosis was weakened. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) study results show that AKK produces the short-chain fatty acids (acetate), which protects against renal fibrosis by suppressing NEU1-TLR4-NFκB-mediated inflammation in the kidney.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings establish a novel gut-kidney axis wherein fucoidan ameliorates renal fibrosis through AKK-mediated acetate production and subsequent NEU1-TLR4-NFκB pathway inhibition."

How this intricate structure of the ER membrane system is maintained under conditions of mechanical strain is incompletely understood. NOMO is an ER-resident transmembrane protein that contributes to ER morphology and is highly expressed in striated muscle. In this study, we identify a critical interface between distal Ig domains that enables NOMO to maintain ER morphology and bear mechanical forces. By incorporating two independent tension sensors in the luminal domain of NOMO, we demonstrate that NOMO assemblies experience forces in the single piconewton range, with a significant contribution from the identified interface. These newly defined features are important-if not indispensable-for myogenesis, as interface mutations affecting mechanosensitivity fail to restore the essential role of NOMO during myogenesis in a C2C12 differentiation model. Moreover, NOMO depletion impairs nematode motility, underscoring a broader functional importance in muscle physiology."

Complementing this approach, advancements in techniques for evaluating lean muscle mass, such as dual-energy biomarkers and computed tomography (CT), have improved the accuracy of muscle mass determination. When conducted by experienced practitioners, ultrasound offers a fast, reliable, and reproducible method for assessing muscle mass. Additionally, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has benefited from technological and methodological improvements, allowing the use of body cell mass as a guide for protein administration. Energy expenditure is most accurately measured using indirect calorimetry, which should be performed regularly due to day-to-day fluctuations and prevent the risks of overfeeding or underfeeding.\n\nSUMMARY: All these progresses are paving the way to precision nutrition in intensive care, determining more accurately the energy needs and adapting the macronutrient administration according to body composition and not anymore by kilogram weight."

While initially investigated in the context of oncogenesis, recent studies have just indicated its importance to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) like cardiac myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (HF). This review focuses on therapeutic targets, regulatory mechanisms and signaling crosstalk between Hippo YAP/TAZ pathway with other traditional pathways like PI3K/AKT, TGF-β, WNT/β-catenin in CVD. Thus, although targeted YAP/TAZ activation in the myocardium may enhance regeneration/differentiation, its dysregulation promotes maladaptive cardiac remodeling characterized by hypertrophy and fibrosis. A better appreciation of the nuanced control on YAP/TAZ in different cardiovascular indications may point to an opportunity for precision therapeutics. In this review, we have discussed strategies to target specific components of the Hippo pathway as potential therapeutic approaches with implications for fibrosis reduction by LATS1/2 inhibition or cardiomyocyte survival promotion via MST1/2 suppression. The role of noncoding RNAs in YAP/TAZ activity modulation is further illustrated and provides us with possible therapeutic avenues that can be explored for noninvasive treatments."

In this study, we aimed to explore the role of mitochondrial dysfunction-related genetic variations in determining the natural age at menopause (ANM) by applying both Mendelian randomization (MR) and summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approaches, complemented by experimental validation in animal models.\n\nMETHODS: Summary statistics on ANM, gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein abundance quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL, pQTL) were obtained from public databases. Genetic variations associated with mitochondrial dysfunction were selected as instrumental variables, and SMR analysis was performed to investigate causal relationships with ANM. MR methods were also used to evaluate the causal effect of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) on ANM, with preliminary validation through animal experiments.\n\nRESULTS: SMR and meta-analysis results identified NSUN4 as a critical regulator of ANM at both the gene expression and DNA methylation levels. A preliminary causal relationship between reduced mtDNA-CN and increased ANM risk was found, though further validation with larger datasets is needed. Animal experiments indicated that NSUN4 levels in blood reflect ovarian function decline and may correlate with its expression in ovarian tissue.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that NUSN4 levels detected in the blood could serve as a potential biomarker for ovarian aging. This provides new insights into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in reproductive age-related traits and may inform future targeted interventions to slow ovarian aging."

Using the Gene Expression Omnibus database and the dbEMT 2.0 database, EMT‑related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with DN were identified. Key EMT‑related genes were subjected to weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, machine learning and protein‑protein interaction network analyses and validated against validation datasets from GEO database. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance of these hub genes. To delve into their cellular clustering in DN, single‑nucleus RNA sequencing was conducted using the Kidney Integrative Transcriptomics database. Additionally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to determine the proportion of immune cell infiltration in DN samples. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) was used to assess the mRNA expression of fibronectin 1 (FN1) in the kidney of mice and patients with DN. After silencing FN1, the expression changes of EMT markers (E‑cadherin and vimentin) were detected by RT‑qPCR. FN1 was upregulated in DN, demonstrating good diagnostic performance according to ROC analysis. FN1 was associated with infiltration of immune cells. RT‑qPCR confirmed the increased expression of FN1 in the kidney of mice with DN and in the renal biopsy samples of patients with DN. After silencing FN1, the expression of E‑cadherin was upregulated, while the expression of vimentin was downregulated, indicating that EMT was inhibited. The present study identified FN1 as a diagnostic marker for DN. FN1 may serve key roles in the initiation and progression of DN by participating in EMT and upregulating various types of immune cells."

This review explores strategies for metabolic assessment and tailored nutritional interventions and their impact on weaning outcomes, highlighting individualized nutritional interventions. While indirect calorimetry provides direct metabolic data, diaphragm ultrasound can complement metabolic monitoring by assessing respiratory muscle function and detecting early signs of muscle wasting. Protein intake in critically ill patients remains controversial, as early high protein administration (greater than 1.2 g/kg each day) has not demonstrated clear benefits and may even be detrimental to successful ventilator weaning, supporting the adoption of a moderate, individualized nutritional strategy. Vitamin D deficiency is common in critically ill patients, and targeted supplementation may reduce mechanical ventilation duration. High-fat and ketogenic diets have shown limited benefit and are not currently recommended. Some nutritional supplements ( e.g. , creatine, branched-chain amino acids, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate) are under investigation, but current evidence does not support their routine use. A personalized approach integrating metabolic assessment, tailored protein intake, and vitamin D optimization may improve weaning success, functional recovery, and post-intensive care unit outcomes.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving BP control (<140/90 mmHg). The co-primary endpoints included mean reductions in mean sitting SBP (msSBP), mean sitting DBP (msDBP), and mean sitting pulse pressure (msPP) at week 8. Secondary outcomes assessed dose-dependent BP reduction.\n\nRESULTS: BP control was achieved in 94.9% of patients in the Sac-Val group versus 69.2% in the control group ( P  = 0.03). Sac-Val significantly reduced msPP (-6.05 mmHg, P  = 0.008) and showed a trend toward greater msSBP reduction ( P  = 0.06). The 400 mg dose resulted in the greatest BP reduction, particularly for msPP ( P  = 0.034). No deaths were reported.\n\nCONCLUSION: Sac-Val was more effective than standard therapy in achieving BP control and reducing BP in resistant hypertension, with a dose-dependent trend favoring the 400 mg regimen. These findings support Sac-Val as a potential treatment alternative for high-risk Afro-descendant patients."

Salivary S100B showed 100 % specificity for mild TBI and 100 % sensitivity for moderate TBI (MAIS/Head). Plasma S100B exhibited 100 % sensitivity for severe TBI (GCS ≤8). Both biomarkers did not distinguish between moderate and severe injuries.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma and salivary S100B levels effectively discriminate mild from severe TBI, complementing current clinical severity scales. Their use may support rapid decision-making in emergency departments, especially given the simplicity, non-invasiveness, and feasibility of salivary sampling. These findings support integrating S100B measurement into TBI management protocols to enhance clinical accuracy and patient outcomes."

    "text": "Anticancer peptide (ACP) has emerged as potent therapeutic agents owing to its ability to selectively target cancer cells while minimising toxicity to healthy cells. However, the accurate computational prediction of ACP remains challenging because of the complex molecular mechanisms underlying cancer. In this study, we introduce EnsemPred-ACP, an innovative ensemble framework that combines machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to enhance ACP prediction. Our primary innovation is the introduction of binary profile features (BPF) to augment pre-trained protein embeddings, thereby capturing position-specific patterns crucial for ACP identification. The framework used a dual-pipeline architecture; ML models processed handcrafted sequence features and embeddings, whereas DL models handled BPF-enhanced embeddings. Upon evaluation with independent datasets, EnsemPred-ACP achieved an accuracy of 0.863, sensitivity of 0.897, and specificity of 0.830, notably outperforming existing methods. The model demonstrated a strong generalisation performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93. Ablation studies on independent datasets further highlighted the substantial impact of BPF, enhancing the prediction accuracy by 2.5 % and 11.1 % when integrated with ESM2 and ProtT5 embeddings, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated approach in accurately identifying potential therapeutic peptides, thereby contributing to the advancement of peptide-based cancer therapeutics."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED) is a rare movement disorder characterized by choreoathetosis and dystonia triggered by sustained exercise, commonly affecting the lower extremities. PED is an autosomal dominant disorder genetically linked to mutations in the SLC2A1 gene. The transmembrane protein Glut1, encoded by the SLC2A1 gene, can transport glucose from blood to the brain. This study aimed to characterize the genetic and clinical features of SLC2A1-related PED.\n\nMETHODS: We reported two Chinese PED families presenting with involuntary movements after prolonged exercise. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on two probands, and cosegregation analysis was subsequently carried out in available family members. Additionally, we summarized and analyzed the genetic and clinical features of SLC2A1-related PED by retrieving information from the literature.\n\nRESULTS: Genetic testing identified two missense mutations in SLC2A1 in these families, including a known disease-causing mutation, c.997C>T (p.R333W), and a novel mutation, c.823G>C (p.A275P). Upon review of the literature, mutations in certain regions of the Glut1 protein, particularly in transmembrane segments 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, together with the intracellular domain, were more frequently seen in PED. Among the various types of epilepsy, absence seizures were the most common in patients with PED. Furthermore, familial PED had a later onset and a higher cerebrospinal fluid/blood glucose ratio. Patients with missense mutations exhibited a later onset than those with truncated mutations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a new disease-causing mutation and, through an extensive literature review, provided a detailed genetic and clinical description of PED associated with SLC2A1 mutations."

To train an AI model, however, a large dataset is typically required, especially when using the most powerful techniques. Therefore, not all specialties are taking advantage of AI techniques in the same way. For instance, they are seldomly used in areas such as the diagnosis of rare diseases since, due to their low prevalence, not enough data are typically available to train an AI model. In this paper, we address the use of AI techniques to diagnose a particular rare disease: Collagen VI-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy from confocal microscopy images. We apply both classical machine learning and modern deep learning techniques and we show that, when using the appropriate data management and training procedures, one can successfully derive a highly-accurate classifier even with a limited amount of training data. Due to the generality of the explored techniques, this conclusion is likely to hold also for most of the rare diseases whose diagnosis relies on the examination of histological images."

These models have shown immense potential in biomedical applications, including drug discovery, protein design, and understanding disease mechanisms at the molecular level. However, PLMs are typically pre-trained on residue sequences alone, with limited incorporation of structural information, presenting opportunities for further enhancement. In this paper, we propose Structure Information Injecting Tuning (SI-Tuning), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to integrate structural information into PLMs. SI-Tuning maintains the original model parameters in a frozen state while optimizing task-specific vectors for input embedding and attention maps. Structural features, including dihedral angles and distance maps, are used to derive this vector, injecting the structural information that improves model performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on 650M ESM-2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our SI-Tuning across multiple downstream tasks. Specifically, our SI-Tuning achieves an accuracy of 93.95% on DeepLoc binary classification, and 76.05% on Metal Ion Binding, outperforming SaProt, a large-scale pre-trained PLM with structural modeling. SI-Tuning effectively enhances the performance of PLMs by incorporating structural information in a parameter-efficient manner. Our method not only advances downstream task performance, but also offers significant computational efficiency, making it a valuable strategy for applying large-scale PLM to broad biomedical downstream applications.

Both the reduced form (HD5red) and the oxidized form (HD5oxi) exist in vivo and exhibit distinct antimicrobial activity spectra. In this study, we developed an efficient method to overexpress recombinant HD5 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3) strain by using calmodulin (CaM), which also interacts with antimicrobial peptides, as a fusion partner. Fusion expression suppressed the degradation of HD5 and reduced its toxicity to host cells. Following purification of the fusion protein and enzymatic cleavage to release the HD5 region, we successfully obtained sufficient amounts (yielding 1.5-1.7 mg/L culture) of active recombinant HD5oxi and HD5red for various applications, including stable isotope-labeled peptides for NMR analysis. Furthermore, we investigated the protective effect of CaM fusion and the mechanism of disulfide bond formation using CD and NMR spectroscopy, structural prediction, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results suggest that the appropriate interaction strength between CaM and the HD5 region in the fusion state is a key factor for stable production."

The present study aimed to assess in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics of akuamma alkaloids using a sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS)-based bioanalytical method. The method was found to be simple, sensitive, and rapid, effectively evaluating absorption, distribution, metabolism, and oral/intravenous pharmacokinetics in male Sprague-Dawley rats. These alkaloids demonstrated high permeability using human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell monolayers. Akuammine and akuammiline showed half-lives of 13.5 and 30.3 min in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-supplemented rat liver microsomes. Pseudo-akuammigine showed the highest plasma protein binding, followed by the other alkaloids. Oral dosing of the ground seed suspension revealed significant systemic exposure of only akuammine, with low oral bioavailability. This research is the first comprehensive report on the ADME properties and pharmacokinetics of akuamma alkaloids, providing critical insights for developing these compounds as potential phytotherapeutic agents for pain management or other medicinal uses."

However, its mechanisms in early-stage abortion (ESA) remain unclear.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel network pharmacology workflow was developed to identify bioactive compounds in SBG, including the nontargeted detection of SBG components, extraction of compounds from the HERB database, manual screening and filtering. These compounds were confirmed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Targets associated with bioactive compounds were enriched via the SWISS database, and disease-related targets were identified via GeneCards. Overlapping targets were analyzed to construct a protein - protein interaction (PPI) network, with interactions predicted via STRING and visualized via Cytoscape. Molecular docking, dynamic simulations, and transcriptomics were used to prioritize key bioactive compounds. Two ESA models were used to evaluate therapeutic effects: one induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the other by mifepristone (Ru486). Decidual histopathology was observed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and hematoxylin - eosin (HE) staining. Key targets and pathways were validated through network pharmacology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), Western blotting (WB), and ELISA. Finally, the effects of SBG on pregnancy maintenance were investigated by modulating the HIF-1α pathway, with a focus on its impact on critical biomarkers identified through the screening process.\n\nRESULTS: Compared with RU486, SBG demonstrated greater efficacy in treating LPS-induced ESAs, as evidenced by lower embryo absorption rates, fewer miscarriages, and milder decidual pathological changes. Through multilevel screening, we identified 10 compounds in SBG with the highest drug potential, which were confirmed in the original plant. These compounds are predicted to specifically modulate LPS-ESA through 38 targets, influencing 525 biological processes and 126 signaling pathways. Integrated pharmacological analysis highlighted the HIF-1α signaling pathway as the key mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of SBG on ESAs. Experiments involving HIF-1α pathway activation and inhibition confirmed that SBG inhibits decidual and embryonic cell apoptosis and hypoxia by blocking HIF-1α signal transmission.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study established a rigorous framework for screening and analyzing the therapeutic components of SBG and revealed that SBG is specifically effective against ESAs and maternal-fetal interface inflammation through the HIF-1α signaling pathway. These findings highlight SBG as a therapeutic agent for ESA and provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies."

PANoptosis, an integrated cell death pathway that combines apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, has been implicated in inflammatory diseases; however, its role in LN and potential as a therapeutic target remain unexplored. Total glucosides of paeony (TGP), a traditional Chinese medicine derived from Paeonia lactiflora Pall, has shown promise in LN treatment due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying its renoprotective effects, particularly its potential regulation of PANoptosis, are poorly understood.\n\nPURPOSE: This study investigated the role of PANoptosis in LN pathogenesis and elucidated the therapeutic mechanisms of TGP, focusing on ZBP1-mediated podocytes PANoptosis.\n\nMETHODS: Four mRNA microarray datasets of renal tissues from patients with LN and LN mouse models were obtained from the GEO database, and were performed with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify PANoptosis-related pathways. Renal pathology was assessed using HE staining and proteinuria detection. Cell death was evaluated in vivo using TUNEL staining and in vitro through flow cytometry and LDH release assay. The protein levels of ZBP1 and PANoptosis markers were detected by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\nRESULTS: PANoptosis-related pathways were significantly enriched in LN kidneys. TGP treatment suppressed podocytes PANoptosis and alleviated renal injury in MRL/lpr mice. Mechanistically, TGP inhibited PANoptosis by regulating the STAT2-ZBP1 axis, with ZBP1 identified as a pivotal regulator. ZBP1 overexpression attenuated the therapeutic effects of TGP, confirming its central role in LN pathogenesis.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals ZBP1-mediated podocytes PANoptosis as a key mechanism in LN and establishes TGP as a promising therapeutic agent targeting this pathway. These findings provide a novel, clinically translatable strategy for LN treatment."

The butyrate group received oral butyrate (300 mg/day) for 16 weeks. We measured postural balance in supine, tandem, and semi-tandem positions using a standardized tool. We also measured handgrip strength (HGS), gait speed, plasma zonulin and lipopolysaccharides-binding protein (LBP) levels as markers of intestinal leak in the study participants.\n\nRESULTS: At baseline, the balance scores, HGS, gait speed, plasma zonulin, and LBP levels were similar in the two groups. Butyrate supplementation was associated with a significant increase in HGS and gait speed and a reduction in plasma zonulin and LBP levels (all p < 0.05), which were not observed in the placebo group. Participants with higher postural balance exhibited higher HGS, gait speed, and lower plasma zonulin and LBP than participants with poor postural balance. We also observed dynamic associations of balance scores with HGS, gait speed, plasma zonulin, and LBP levels in the butyrate group. However, plasma CRP and 8-isoprostane levels were not affected by the butyrate supplement.\n\nCONCLUSION: Altogether, butyrate mitigates postural imbalance in older adults, which, at least partly, involves intestinal mucosal repair and improvement in skeletal muscle strength and gait speed."

The regulation of LAT1 function and stability by cholesterol was previously described in ex vivo and in vitro experimental models. The complexity of the relationship between LAT1 and cholesterol has been further studied by investigating the impact of selected oxidized forms of cholesterol, focusing on the most abundant auto-oxidized form of cholesterol, namely 7-ketocholesterol, which increases with age and pathologies characterized by high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The partial substitution of cholesterol with 7-ketocholesterol in HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing the human LAT1 (HEK293-LAT1), decreases the Vmax of LAT1 mediated transport and the thermal stability of the protein. The impairing effect on transport was directly tested in LAT1 reconstituted proteoliposomes supplemented with 7-ketocholesterol. In this experimental model, it was found that the presence of 7-ketocholesterol altered the transport stimulation by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as previously described. This was likely due to the higher rigidity of 7-ketocholesterol compared to cholesterol, which alters the membrane/protein interaction, weakening the ATP binding to LAT1. LAT1 transport function was also inhibited when proteoliposomes were supplemented with 7α-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. These deleterious effects may be relevant in chronic pathological conditions characterized by altered cholesterol/oxysterol ratios, ranging from metabolic syndrome to kidney disease and neurological disorders."

The bitterness arises from the specific sequence of amino acids in peptides, which interact with the bitter taste receptors on the human tongue. These peptides influence nutrition and health, offering insights into protein digestion and bioactive advantages. Hence, correctly identifying bitter peptides is pivotal for revealing the biochemical properties of efficient medication. The computational approach is most suitable for identifying bitterness, where most studies obtained insufficient outcomes. Therefore, the current study developed an ensemble-based framework called \"BitterEN\", where we integrate the Gradient Boosting (GB) and Multi-layer Perception (MLP) methods. Our proposed method improved more than 3 % of accuracy compare to all of the state-of-the-arts methods, where the proposed approach achieved 0.995 accuracy in merged feature extractions with the Random Forest (RF) feature selection method.

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of 3-methoxytyramine (3MT) is essential for diagnosing metastatic pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. Despite the growing use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 3MT quantification, poor comparability persists among laboratories. This study developed an isotope dilution LC-MS/MS-based candidate reference measurement procedure (cRMP) for plasma and urine 3MT measurement and evaluated LC-MS/MS results from over 100 laboratories in China.\n\nMETHODS: Plasma/urine samples were spiked with internal standard, followed by protein precipitation and solid-phase extraction. The final extract was analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The cRMP assigned values to four samples (202411-202414), which were sent on dry ice to over 100 laboratories in China for analysis using routine LC-MS/MS methods. Laboratory results were compared to cRMP-assigned target values.\n\nRESULTS: The method validation of cRMP showed good precision, with intra-run and total imprecision ranging from 0.97% to 3.85% and 0.99% to 4.03%, respectively. The relative recovery rate ranged from 99.51% to 104.61%. Significant biases were observed when comparing the measurement results of routine laboratories with the target values assigned by cRMP, and the results from different laboratories were not comparable.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our LC-MS/MS cRMP demonstrates high accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity for 3MT measurements. By utilizing SI-traceable certified reference materials(3MT Cerilliant standard), it ensures robust traceability. This cRMP serves as a high-order standard for establishing traceability, calibrating routine methods, and developing reference materials, supporting the standardization of 3MT assays."

Exercise interventions to stimulate skeletal muscle are therapeutic for sarcopenia and limit risk and/or provide neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disease models. Metabolic analysis of aged skeletal muscle has identified altered skeletal muscle metabolomes at an old age. Many of the molecules identified are amino acids that also act as neurotransmitters. In this review, we summarize how 13 amino acids act as neurotransmitters or as precursor to neurotransmitters, and how these are involved in the skeletal muscle secretome, sarcopenia, and (healthy) aging."

    "text": "Fibroblasts play a key role in maintaining skin structure and immune balance, but factors like aging, stress, and chronic inflammation can weaken their function, leading to collagen loss, thinning skin, and increased inflammation. Traditional collagen boosters like retinoic acid (RA), vitamin C (VC), hyaluronic acid (HA), and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) have drawbacks, including poor absorption, instability, and irritation. Studies reveal that Silk Bioactive Peptide (27 P peptide) binds to epidermis and dermal fibroblasts, enhancing prolonged pro-collagen 1 (pro-C1) secretion in 3D and 2D models. De-novo collagen synthesis by 27 P peptide, likely regulated at the translational level, resulted in elevated collagen deposition and matrix remodeling up to 120 h. Combination of VC and 27 P peptide rescues VC-induced intracellular collagen depletion. Unlike TGFβ and RA, 27 P peptide maintains balance between fibroblast subpopulations, without inducing markers of fibrosis or inflammation. Together, 27 P peptide presents as a promising alternative to effectively promote collagen production, fibroblast homeostasis and skin health."

The changes of radiomics features from pre-treatment and post-treatment gastric computed tomography images were extracted to build delta radiomics score and predict TR, as well as another radiomics score from pre-treatment vertebral computed tomography images for the prediction of HT, and both combined models were established from clinicopathological characteristics and radiomics score. The predictive performance of the combined models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristics, calibration and decision curve analyses. Interpretability was assessed using the shapley additive explanations framework (SHAP).\n\nRESULTS: The area under curve (AUC) in the combined model for predicting TR were 0.893,0.846 and 0.913 for the training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. The AUC in the combined model for predicting HT were 0.871, 0.917 and 0.865 for the training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. SHAP summary plots show the importance of each feature on the prediction outcome, while waterfall and force plots depict individual features' contributions to a response variable.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The combined models based on radiomics features for predicting TR and HT after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in LAGC demonstrated good predictive performance."

While ferroptosis has emerged as a pivotal contributor to renal fibrogenesis, the regulatory mechanisms governing this process-particularly those involving iron metabolism-remain poorly characterized.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism through which silybin modulates FTH1 to regulate iron homeostasis, thereby suppressing ferroptosis and attenuating fibrotic progression in renal pathology.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: The therapeutic efficacy of ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and silybin was systematically evaluated in complementary in vivo and in vitro renal fibrosis models. Mechanistic investigations employed FTH1 knockout and overexpression systems to validate its role as a therapeutic target.\n\nMETHODS: Fibrotic inhibition was assessed histologically and via quantification of fibrotic markers. Iron ion concentrations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using standardized commercial assay kits. The silybin-FTH1 interaction was investigated through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Silybin administration demonstrated potent ferroptosis inhibition, significantly ameliorating pathological alterations and fibrotic marker expression across experimental models. FTH1 ablation exacerbated ferroptotic cell death and fibrotic progression, whereas FTH1 overexpression conferred robust protection against renal fibrosis. Mechanistically, silybin directly bound FTH1 protein, stabilizing its expression to counteract iron overload-induced ferroptosis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study unveils FTH1 stabilization as a mechanistically novel strategy to disrupt the vicious cycle of iron overload and ferroptosis in renal fibrosis, offering a superior alternative to conventional ferroptosis inhibitors targeting downstream effectors."

RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in hypertrophic and control cardiac tissues. CircRNA expression levels were verified by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Isoproterenol (ISO) was used to induce hypertrophy of AC16 cells. The extent of cell hypertrophy was indicated by the cell size, protein/DNA ratio and levels of B‑type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and β‑myosin heavy chain (β‑MHC). The interactions between hsa_circ_0072107 and miR‑516b‑5p, as well as between miR‑516b‑5p and zinc ring finger protein 36 (ZFP36), were confirmed through dual luciferase assays, biotinylated probe pull‑down and anti‑AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation assays. hsa_circ_0072107 was one of the most upregulated circRNAs in hypertrophic cardiac tissues. hsa_circ_0072107 overexpression and ISO treatment increased cell size, elevated the protein/DNA ratio and increased the levels of BNP and β‑MHC in AC16 cells, indicating that hsa_circ_0072107 aggravates AC16 hypertrophy. These changes induced by ISO treatment could be blocked by the knockdown of hsa_circ_0072107. The dual‑luciferase activity assay indicated that miR‑516b‑5p can bind to hsa_circ_0072107. miR‑516b‑5p binding site mutation blocked the effect of hsa_circ_0072107. ZFP36 is a target gene of miR‑516b‑5p, which suppresses AC16 hypertrophy. hsa_circ_0072107 overexpression alleviated the effect of miR‑516b‑5p overexpression on cell hypertrophy and ZFP36 expression. hsa_circ_0072107 is up‑regulated in hypertrophic cardiac tissues and potentially promotes AC16 hypertrophy and may play its role by acting as a competitive endogenous RNA of miR‑516b‑5p. Thus, hsa_circ_0072107 may be a novel target for the treatment of myocardial hypertrophy."

Therefore, finding effective inhibitors for this toxin has garnered a lot of attention. In this regard, we performed an in silico study to find effective inhibitors against this toxin. To this end, the structure of ETX and an experimentally approved ETX inhibitor were prepared and docked as a control interaction and used for the determination of the binding site. An approved library of small molecules was obtained from the DrugBank database and prepared for virtual screening via size filtering and the addition of conformations. The top five molecules with the highest binding energy were used to draw their 2D interaction plots against ETX. A 100 ns MD simulation was performed on the Antrafenine-ETX complex as the best result of the screening stage in comparison to the control complex. The obtained results showed that among the 3849 molecules (which were analyzed by virtual screening), Cefotiam, Antrafenine, Ferric Derisomaltose, Mupirocin, and Salmeterol had the highest binding energies (binding energies respectively calculated to be -5.6, -5.8, -4.9, -4.9, and -4.6 kcal/mol). The 2D interaction plots also showed that the screened molecules had stronger interacting bonds with the ETX protein. MD simulations showed that the Antrafenine-ETX complex has a similar RMSD plot to the control complex, while its RMSF, hydrogen bond, and GR plots show better results for the Antrafenine-ETX complex. In light of these results, Antrafenine could be the best choice for ETX inhibition regarding strength, while based on the route of administration and drug applications, Cefotiam could also be considered for ETX inhibition. It seems that despite the promising results of the performed in silico studies, further empirical pieces of evidence would strengthen these conclusions in future studies."

Importantly, its occurrence is expected to increase exponentially with global warming. Chronic hyponatraemia is associated with an increased risk of falling, osteoporosis and fractures, attention deficits, and even mortality. In the past two decades, a growing number of studies have suggested that correcting hyponatraemia improves clinical outcomes, outlining hyponatraemia management as a part of promoting healthy ageing. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors and protein supplementation have been shown to be efficacious in treating hyponatraemia, both of which represent attractive and holistic treatment options in older adults. However, despite hyponatraemia being encountered in all medical specialties, its clinical burden is often overlooked, partly due to low awareness but also to low confidence in applying diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. In this Review, we aim to depict the consequences of hyponatraemia, characterize the most common aetiologies in older individuals, and finally detail the diagnostic pathway as well as the benefits and limitations of the available treatment options."

We employed multiple statistical methods and bioinformatics tools to identify shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, we conducted functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and TF-gene interaction network analysis, as well as TF-miRNA coregulatory network analysis. Drug compounds were predicted using the Drug Signatures database based on the common DEGs. Immune infiltration analysis was conducted on sarcopenia and atherosclerosis datasets. Finally, ROC curves were plotted to verify the reliability of our results using external databases.\n\nRESULT: We identified 11 upregulated and 17 downregulated DEGs that were enriched in microglial cell activation, plasma membrane raft, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate binding.

This study aims to, for the first time, comprehensively interpret the short and long-term effects of MRF by combining histology, high-throughput molecular analysis, and clinical evaluation.\n\nMETHODS: At 1, 3, and 6 months after MRF in different parameters, the skin samples were taken for HE staining, Masson staining, and Victoria blue staining to observe the overall histological changes. Real-time PCR and WB were used to evaluate the quantitative changes of collagen I and III, MMP-2 and TGF-β1 at the different time periods. After transcriptome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify important biological processes related to skin after MRF treatment. At the same time, patients who had undergone facial MRF treatment in our department between 2020 and 2023 were collected for clinical review within half a year after treatment. Patient satisfaction score and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) were collected.\n\nRESULTS: The histological sections showed that collagen and elastic fibers regenerated and the density increased after MRF. The mRNA and protein levels of collagen in each treatment group also showed an upward trend after treatment, especially in Group A. However, there was no significant difference among the treatment groups and compared with the blank control group. Transcriptome analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in collagen regeneration-related pathways at 1 month after treatment, then gradually decreased at 6 months. The clinical data showed that after MRF treatment, patients mainly rated the effect of skin rejuvenation as \"3 - satisfied.\" The GAIS score showed that the long-term effect after MRF was better than the short-term effect (p = 0.040).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: MRF can stimulate collagen rearrangement and rejuvenation in facial rejuvenation. The long-term rejuvenation effect of MRF can last at least 6 months and is better than the short-term effect."

The Chuanhong Zhongfeng (CHZF) Capsule, developed by national medical master Jixue Ren, has been clinically proven to promote neurological function recovery, reduce disability rates, and improve long-term prognosis in patients with cerebral infarction. However, the specific targets and potential mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate, for the first time, the potential targets of CHZF Capsule in treating ACI and improving long-term prognosis, thereby providing direction for future research on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compounds in ACI prevention and treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06874140).\n\nMETHODS: The study focused on identifying unique differential proteins in ACI patients treated with CHZF Capsule. Twenty ACI patients were divided into a medication group (CHZ) and a control group (DZZ) based on CHZF Capsule administration. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using 4D label-free proteome quantification technology to identify differential proteins between the groups. Functional enrichment analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO) classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, was conducted to determine enrichment trends related to differential proteins. Hierarchical clustering was employed to identify relevant pathways enriched in each group based on P-values from the enrichment analysis. The STRING (v.11.5) protein interactions network database was utilized to obtain differential protein interactions, corresponding target proteins, and major related pathways. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was subsequently applied to validate the selected target proteins. Finally, chord diagrams and ROC curves were plotted for visualization and analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Mass spectrometry analysis identified 1400 proteins, of which 1360 were quantitatively comparable. Using a P-value < 0.05 and change thresholds of > 1.5 for significant up-regulation and < 1/1.5 for significant down-regulation, 63 differential proteins were identified (27 upregulated and 36 downregulated). Cluster analysis revealed that Q4 (>2.0) was most closely associated with the complement and coagulation cascade pathway (hsp04610). Six proteins involved in acute inflammatory responses and immune processes were validated through PRM experiments: Complement factor H-related protein (CFHR) 4, Mannose-binding lectin protein (MBL) 2, Orosomucoid (ORM) 1, ORM2, Vascular non-inflammatory factor (VNN) 1, and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A. Chord plots and ROC curve analysis suggested the following order of biomarker sensitivity: CFHR4 > MBL2 > VNN1 > ORM1 = ORM2 > HLA-A.\n\nCONCLUSION: The observed changes in these six proteins in ACI patients may serve as indicators of long-term prognosis. The complement and coagulation cascade pathway is closely associated with ACI development. These findings provide a basis for ACI recurrence prevention and contribute to the development of integrated Chinese and Western medicine approaches for ACI treatment."

While the protective effects of physical activity (PA) are well-documented, less is known about the interplay between PA, low-grade inflammation, and mental health. Biobehavioural mechanisms underpinning mental health may become more prominent when encountering novel stressors, which were particularly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging data of a national sample of older adults from England, this study tested (1) if pre-pandemic PA and its changes during the pandemic were associated with mental health responses; (2) if older adults with low-grade inflammation experienced greater increases in depression and anxiety, compared to pre-pandemic levels; (3) if PA attenuated the inflammation-mental health associations.\n\nMETHODS: The study used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a cohort study following a national sample aged 50 + (N = 5829). Information on mental health and PA was collected before the pandemic (2016/17 and 2018/19) and during November and December 2020. Inflammation was ascertained using pre-pandemic C-reactive protein (CRP). Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related factors and pre-pandemic mental health.\n\nRESULTS: Increasing PA from before to during the pandemic was linked to reduced odds of depression (OR = 0.955, 95 % CI [0.937; 0.974]) and anxiety (OR = 0.954, 95 % CI [0.927; 0.982]). Higher pre-pandemic PA was associated with reduced odds of depression (OR = 0.964, 95 % CI [0.948; 0.981]) and anxiety (OR = 0.976, 95 % CI [0.953; 1.000]), whereas elevated CRP was associated with 1.343 times higher odds of depression (95 % CI [1.100; 1.641]). PA did not attenuate the inflammation-depression association.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that PA may contribute to psychological resilience against stressful life events among older adults but does not appear to mitigate the adverse effects of systemic inflammation on mental health. Further research is needed to explore the psychobiological pathways underlying this protective mechanism."

    "text": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe obesity and associated with increased oxidative stress. This phenomenon is partly attributed to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, contributing to significant metabolic complications. Growth hormone (GH) treatment is widely used in children with PWS due to its well-documented benefits, including improvements in body composition, motor development, and cognitive function. In this study, we assessed the oxidative stress profile in children with PWS treated with GH. Since obesity and inflammation are well-established contributors to oxidative stress, values obtained from non-syndromic obese patients were included as a reference, allowing the findings to be contextualized within the framework of oxidative stress. The study included 12 GH-treated PWS children with a mean age of 15 years and 11 non-syndromic obese patients with a mean age of 14 years. Flow cytometry was employed as the primary method to analyse markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in both groups. Additionally, this technique enabled the identification of immune cell populations associated with chronic inflammation, acute inflammation, and immune response, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Despite PWS children having 4- to 6-fold lower glutathione (GSH) levels, PWS children demonstrated 2- to 3.5-fold higher mitochondrial activity, increasing their antioxidant capacity and reducing lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation by up to 2-fold compared to non-syndromic obese children. GH-treated PWS children also showed lower mitochondrial dysfunction under oxidative conditions, higher cell viability, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting a link to senescence and premature ageing. GH-treated PWS children, despite being non-obese, exhibited higher systemic inflammation compared to the non-syndromic obese group, alongside significant differences in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that mitochondrial pathways may play a role in antioxidant responses in PWS, highlighting the complexity of oxidative stress and its potential contribution to premature ageing in this condition. Understanding these mechanisms and the role of GH treatment could inform the development of targeted therapies to better manage oxidative stress and inflammation, ultimately improving the quality of life for PWS children."

We validated correlations using published sequencing data, flow cytometry, and immunoblots.\n\nRESULTS: Using unsupervised clustering of protein arrays, we found that immune markers like PD-L1 are upregulated in distinct subsets of Wilms tumor, the most common pediatric kidney cancer. Specifically, chemotherapy-exposed Wilms tumor specimens exhibited higher levels of PD-L1 expression, and common chemotherapeutics upregulated PD-L1 in vitro. Furthermore, mutations in CTNNB1 and DROSHA, the two most commonly mutated genes in Wilms tumor, correlated with higher PD-L1. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and knockdown of DROSHA or DICER1 both increase PD-L1 in vitro.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, our results identify clinical and biological properties regulating PD-L1 in Wilms tumor that may inform precision therapy approaches in pediatric immuno-oncology."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: This review characterizes shifts of the oral microbial community on carious root surfaces compared to sound root surfaces.\n\nDATA AND SOURCES: A systematic search of English-language publications on clinical studies evaluating oral microbiomes in patients with root caries using high-throughput sequencing technologies published before April 1, 2025, was included. The search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus. Gray literature was searched in ClinicalTrials.gov and Google Scholar.\n\nSTUDY SELECTION/RESULTS: Based on the eligibility criteria, 1133 publications were screened, and 465 duplicates were removed. Of the remaining 16 studies assessed for full-text review, eight investigating the oral microbiome of saliva, carious roots, or dental plaque in patients with root caries were included. These studies reported the intra-community species diversity (alpha-diversity, 4/8 studies), inter-community compositional diversity (beta-diversity, 4/8 studies), dominant microbial genera/species (8/8 studies), and functional pathways (1/8 studies) of the microbial community in root caries patients. Alpha-diversity showed no significant difference between root caries and sound root surfaces in three studies, but root caries exhibited a significantly lower alpha diversity in one study. Beta-diversity differed significantly between root caries and sound root surfaces in three studies, with one study reporting no difference. The dominant microbial species in root caries varied among the included studies. However, Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella denticola, Propionibacterium acidifaciens, Streptococcus mutans, and Veillonella parvula/dispar were frequently identified in the root caries-associated microbiota. Furthermore, root caries-associated bacteria altered the predicted functional pathways, promoting organic acid production and accelerating collagen degradation.\n\nCONCLUSION: Root caries microbiomes exhibit distinct compositional profiles, dysbiotic species predominance, and a shift in predicted functional pathways compared to healthy root surfaces.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review provides valuable insights into root caries' microbial landscape, potentially guiding future preventative and therapeutic strategies."

However, this has not been consistently demonstrated in adults, nor at all in children.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To test the associations between explicit and implicit food reward and preference at baseline and prospective changes in weight and body composition in adolescents with obesity.\n\nMETHODS: A meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in adolescents with obesity was undertaken using frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models. Participants from each study took part in similar 12-week multidisciplinary interventions. Liking and wanting for foods varying in fat content and sweet taste were assessed at enrolment, and both anthropometrics were tracked from enrolment to post-intervention.\n\nRESULTS: In a grand sample of N = 132 adolescents with obesity, liking and wanting for high-fat foods did not significantly predict changes in weight or fat mass. However, implicit wanting for sweet foods predicted changes in standardised body and lean mass, such that a greater wanting for sweet foods was associated with greater loss of body (p = 0.039, η\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Baseline implicit wanting for sweet (high carbohydrate, low protein), but not energy-dense, foods may be more strongly related to prospective changes in lean mass than fat mass during weight loss in adolescents with obesity. Further research is needed to clarify whether low protein intake can account for this effect."

The inhibitory effects of natural polyphenols and the control chlorhexidine (CHX) on matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 8 (MMP-2 and MMP-8) were assessed using fluorometric assay kits. Bacterial collagenase activity was measured by analyzing the loss of dry mass and released hydroxyproline. In situ zymography (ISZ) was conducted to determine matrix-bound protease activity. Furthermore, in silico molecular docking simulations were performed to investigate the interactions between natural polyphenols and proteases.\n\nRESULTS: SEM observation demonstrated the collagen-protective effects of four natural polyphenols against collagenase digestion. However, only PA showed a performance comparable to CHX group on both recombinant MMP-2 and MMP-8. Concerning bacterial collagenase, PA and EGCG exhibited superior inhibitory effects compared to QUE and RES (p < 0.05). The fluorescence intensity of ISZ indicated stronger suppression of endogenous protease activity in the PA and EGCG groups than in the QUE and RES groups. Molecular docking analysis consistently showed that PA and EGCG had higher binding affinities for both MMP2 and MMP8 than QUE and RES.\n\nCONCLUSION: Natural polyphenols can deactivate both soluble and matrix-bound proteases, the stronger inhibitory effect may be attributed to the formation of more hydrogen bonds.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Natural polyphenolic protease inhibitors with more hydroxyphenyl radicals could potentially enhance anti-proteolytic performance and bonding durability."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Ultra-sensitive detection of biomarkers is critical for disease diagnosis and other applications. Immunoassays, particularly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are commonly used for protein biomarker detection but often suffer from insufficient sensitivity at low concentrations. Enhancing the detection capacity of ELISA for early diagnosis is therefore essential.\n\nRESULTS: Herein, a simple and cost-effective strategy was developed to enhance ELISA performance by pre-enriching target proteins using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). MIPs, synthesized with high absorption capacity and specificity, were prepared using TrF (Transferrin) as the template and polypeptide as crosslinker. Target protein was pre-enriched through large-volume adsorption followed by small-volume elution. This pre-enrichment process resulted in an 8.25-fold increase in protein concentration, significantly improving ELISA sensitivity and reducing the limit of detection (LOD) by nearly an order of magnitude. The enhanced detection performance was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, and linearity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This method, which combines MIP-based protein enrichment with ELISA detection, offers a promising and cost-effective solution for enhancing ELISA performance. It holds great potential as a widely applicable strategy for the sensitive detection of biomarkers in disease diagnostics."

Unfortunately, its overaccumulation in kidney proximal tubular cell (PTC) results in severe acute kidney injury (AKI). Bismuth drugs have long been used to treat gastrointestinal tract disorder and Helicobacter pylori infection. Interestingly, oral administration of bismuth drugs can also mitigate cisplatin-induced AKI, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we found even low concentrations of bismuth can specifically increase the survival rate of human PTC upon excessive cisplatin exposure. Using multiomics and protein-small molecule interaction techniques, we identified mitochondrial iron-binding protein ALKBH7 as a specific target of bismuth. By gene knockout and silencing, we demonstrated that ALKBH7 depletion indeed greatly increases cell survival rate upon excessive cisplatin exposure. Furthermore, we found bismuth treatment depletes ALKBH7 in mice kidney and prevents cisplatin-induced AKI. Overall, our evidence suggests ALKBH7 is a specific target of bismuth drugs, and ALKBH7 inhibitors are potential drug candidates for mitigation of cisplatin-induced AKI."

    "text": "The rising threat of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), necessitates the development of novel antiinfective strategies. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a significant foodborne pathogen, secretes virulence factors that are crucial to its pathogenicity. Unlike conventional antibiotics, antivirulence strategies offer a promising approach by targeting these factors without inhibiting bacterial growth, thereby reducing selective pressure for resistance. Among these factors, von Willebrand factor-binding protein (vWbp) is a key contributor to S. aureus pathogenesis, mediating prothrombin activation and subsequent blood coagulation, which is vital for pathogen survival in the host. This study identified astragaloside IV (As-IV), a bioactive compound from traditional Chinese medicine, as a potent inhibitor of vWbp coagulase. As-IV effectively prolongs coagulation time and reduces S. aureus biotic matrix formation on surfaces relevant to food safety, such as catheters, in vitro. Mechanistic studies, including thermal shift assays (TSAs) and fluorescence quenching, revealed that As-IV directly binds to vWbp, attenuating its activity without altering protein expression levels. In vivo, As-IV exhibited protective effects in infection models, underscoring its potential as a virulence-targeted therapeutic. These findings significantly contribute to the advancement of antivirulence strategies and underscore the potential of As-IV in combating S. aureus infections. This paves the way for its broader application in enhancing public health measures and promoting innovative therapeutic approaches."

    "text": "Drug-resistant bacteria have become a global healthcare challenge, especially due to their acquisition of resistance to last-resort antibiotics. OXA-48 carbapenemase is one of the notorious enzymes that inactivates carbapenems through hydrolysis. The emergence of OXA-48 and OXA-48-like carbapenemases is a significant concern as they are responsible for many outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in various countries, with limited treatment options available. Thus, targeting this enzyme and inhibiting its activity can be an attractive therapeutic strategy. In this study, a rational computer-aided approach was applied to design effective inhibitory peptides against OXA-48 carbapenemase. The primary library was constructed based on peptides derived from the Human Antimicrobial Peptide (HAMP) database. The binding of peptides to the enzyme was investigated through molecular docking studies using ClusPro. After each screening step, numerous targeted amino acid substitutions were performed to enhance the affinity and physicochemical properties of the selected peptides. The final selected peptides, in complex with the enzyme, were subjected to 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the GROMACS package, and MM/PBSA analysis was conducted to evaluate the binding free energy of the enzyme-peptide complexes. Finally, the inhibitory effects of the designed peptides were also computationally assessed on OXA-48-like carbapenemases. Homology modeling was used to generate 3D structures of the enzymes whose structures were not solved experimentally. Results indicated that the two final selected peptides effectively interacted with the important residues of OXA-48 carbapenemase and spatially blocked its active site. These peptides also demonstrated high binding affinity to the most common OXA-48-like carbapenemases in silico. In vitro studies on the efficacy of one of the designed peptides, M104, demonstrated that this peptide enhanced the activity of meropenem against a meropenem-resistant, clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae strain harboring the gene bla"

Replication incompetent rVSV pseudoparticles, which do not encode their envelope proteins necessary for infection, offer increased versatility and rapid manufacturing. Traditionally, pseudotyping has been achieved using adherent host cells transiently expressing foreign glycoproteins, followed by infection of the host cells with a glycoprotein G (VSV-G) presenting virus that is deficient in glycoprotein genes. This adherent production method is challenging to scale up, which limits many applications. We developed a high-yield and scalable process using suspension adapted human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells to produce replication incompetent rVSV. Using a multivariate approach, we optimized production duration to minimize the negative impact of residual transfection components and cellular waste products on viral infection and propagation. This eliminated the need for media exchange and enhanced process scalability. Key process parameters such as multiplicity of infection (MOI) and production duration were optimized to improve pseudoparticle productivity. The suspension process was scaled up to 2 L stirred tank bioreactors, yielding 7.4 × 10"

Trabeculectomy, the most common glaucoma surgery, could fail due to excessive scarring of the filtering bleb, driven by the hyperproliferation of human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs). Herein, the impact of aging on matrix stiffness in Tenon's capsule tissue, the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness in the phenotypic transformation of HTFs, and the regulatory function of integrin alphavbeta6 (αvβ6) were investigated. Matrix stiffness in Tenon's capsule tissue is notably lower in elder glaucoma patients in comparison with younger ones, with reduced levels of α-SMA, collagen I, and integrin αvβ6. GFS (Glaucoma Filtration Surgery) models were established in young and old SD rats, and it was observed that older rats exhibited lower ECM stiffness, reduced fibrosis, and decreased integrin αvβ6 expression. HTFs from elderly glaucoma patients showed reduced ECM stiffness, decreased viability, impaired migration, and diminished fibrotic responses. When HTFs from young glaucoma patients were cultured on substrates of varying stiffness, it was found that stiffer substrates increased cell viability, migration, collagen synthesis, and fibrosis marker expression. Additionally, knocking down integrin αvβ6 in HTFs cultured on stiffer substrates resulted in decreased cell viability, impaired migration, reduced collagen synthesis, and lower fibrosis marker expression. In vivo knockdown of integrin αvβ6 effectively reduced ECM stiffness and fibrosis, thereby attenuating bleb scarring after GFS in young rats. Collectively, the aging-associated changes in ECM stiffness and integrin αvβ6 expression contribute to reduced fibrosis, potentially enhancing the success of trabeculectomy in elder patients."

Sodium and proton MRI datasets from Twenty glioma patients were collected for validation. Twenty-four image-guided biopsies from seven patients were available for sodium-proton exchanger (NHE1) expression evaluation on immunohistochemistry. High-resolution synthetic sodium images were generated using the ATHENA model, then compared to native sodium MRI and NHE1 protein expression from image-guided biopsy samples.\n\nRESULTS: The ATHENA produced synthetic-sodium MR with significantly improved SNR (native SNR 18.20 ± 7.04; synthetic SNR 23.83 ± 9.33, P = 0.0079).

Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based therapies, has become an important approach for CRC treatment. However, only specific patient subsets demonstrate significant clinical benefits. Although the TIDE algorithm can predict immunotherapy responses, the reliance on transcriptome sequencing data limits its clinical applicability. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computational pathology provide new avenues for medical image analysis. In this study, we classified TCGA-CRC samples into immunotherapy responder and non-responder groups using the TIDE algorithm. Further, a pathomics model based on convolutional neural networks was constructed to directly predict immunotherapy responses from histopathological images. Single-cell analysis revealed that fibroblasts may induce immunotherapy resistance in CRC through collagen-CD44 and ITGA1 + ITGB1 signaling axes. The developed pathomics model demonstrated excellent classification performance in the test set, with an AUC of 0.88 at the patch level and 0.85 at the patient level. Moreover, key pathomics features were identified through SHAP analysis.

Studying ncRNA-protein interactions (NPI) can help to explore a wide range of biological features and related diseases. Traditional NPI research methods often require expensive equipment, a lot of time and labor. With the abundant samples accumulated from traditional experiments, remarkable progress has been made in the study of NPI by computational methods. Heterogeneous graph neural network is a deep learning method that synthesizes heterogeneous types of data as well as network topology. In this study, we propose an NPI-HetGNN model for NPI prediction based on heterogeneous graph neural networks. Firstly, initial features are constructed by integrating the sequence properties of ncRNA and protein data as well as the topology of heterogeneous connections. Then, the multilevel homogeneous subgraph is obtained and its semantic information is aggregated by metapath walking. At the same time, the homogeneous node information is fused within the subgraph metapath. To enhance feature extraction ability of the network, an energy-constrained self-attention module is introduced. Due to the lack of wet lab validation conditions, this study adopts computational verification. The performance of the NPI-HetGNN model on four benchmark datasets is experimentally verified. Ablation experiments also confirmed the comprehensiveness and validity of our model design. The experimental results show that comparing with six state-of-the-art methods, our NPI-HetGNN achieves very satisfactory results on all four datasets."

As causative agents of most common colds, RVs originate serious socioeconomic problems, and they are also associated to or exacerbate severe respiratory diseases. No anti-rhinoviral drugs or vaccines are available yet. In this study, amino acid residues that delimit a druggable pocket in the RV capsid were individually replaced by larger residues, which in most cases resulted in impaired virus infectivity. After serial infections of human host cells, the hampered mutant viruses invariably recovered full infectivity. Sequencing of the viral progeny revealed that, contrary to what has been observed when deleterious mutations were introduced in other virus capsid regions, those mutant RVs did not regain infectivity through the fixation of second-site mutations. Instead, infectivity was always recovered through reversion or pseudo-reversion events that replaced the deleterious bulky residue with a smaller residue, even though this strategy required, in some cases, the improbable fixation of two nucleotides in the corresponding codon. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations and determination of mechanical elasticity by atomic force microscopy revealed that the small-to-large, deleterious mutations reduced the capsid conformational flexibility; and the large-to-small, infectivity-restoring (pseudo)reversions led to recovery of the capsid flexibility. The stereochemistry of this druggable hydrophobic pocket in RV appears to be biologically constrained: The deleterious effect of reducing pocket volume and capsid flexibility is reverted during virus propagation only through same-site mutations that restore pocket volume and capsid flexibility. These constraints may help the further development of anti-RV drugs."

Tectorigenin (TEC) is a flavonoid compound extracted from Bupleurum and saponins, which are traditional Chinese medicines with anti-inflammatory properties. Previous experiments have found that it can alleviate CPT-11-induced diarrhoea and synergistically inhibit tumor growth with CPT-11, but the specific mechanisms remain unknown.\n\nMETHODS: A CPT-11-induced diarrhoea mouse model was used to study the protective effect of TEC on CPT-11-induced diarrhoea in mouse by measuring levels of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal tight junction-related proteins in colon tissues. The chemopreventive effect of TEC was evaluated by measuring levels of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal tight junction-related proteins in Caco-2 cells exposed to CPT-11 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, the synergistic effect of TEC combined with CPT-11 on tumor growth was investigated in a mouse model of colon tumors induced by subcutaneous implantation of CT26 colon cancer cells.\n\nRESULTS: TEC inhibited CPT-11-induced intestinal toxicity, as evidenced by reduced weight loss, decreased diarrhoea scores, and less intestinal shortening in mouse. Histological analysis demonstrated that TEC alleviated CPT-11-induced intestinal barrier damage. Additionally, TEC activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2/Keap1) signalling pathway, reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines both in vivo and in vitro, alleviated intestinal inflammation, and increased the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins, thereby enhancing intestinal barrier function. Furthermore, TEC exhibited a synergistic effect with CPT-11 in anti-tumor therapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that TEC alleviates CPT-11-induced intestinal inflammation by activating the Nrf2/Keap1 signalling pathway and enhances the anti-tumor effect of CPT-11 in colon cancer."

    "text": "Interactions between proteins and lipids are crucial for numerous cellular processes. Some of the lipid interacting segments in protein sequences are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which may gain secondary structures upon binding. We collected experimentally annotated lipid-interacting IDRs, named membrane molecular recognition features (MemMoRFs). We used this dataset to develop and test an accurate and relatively fast sequence-based MemMoRF predictor, pLMMoRF, thereby supporting tedious and costly experimental identification of MemMoRFs. Our predictor utilizes a protein language model (pLM) which we processed to generate inputs to a deep convolutional neural network. We considered various pLMs (ESM-2, ProstT5, ProtT5 and Ankh) and applied feature selection to reduce their outputs, creating a more compact neural network model. pLMMoRF leverages the Ankh-based model, selected for its higher accuracy compared to our other models. Tests on low similarity test datasets demonstrate that pLMMoRF is more accurate than the sole current predictor of MemMoRFs, CoMemMoRFPred. Moreover, pLMMoRF has a relatively small computational footprint because of the compact network size and use of dedicated GPU nodes. This allowed us to make MemMoRF predictions for the human proteome. We analyzed these predictions and made them publicly available, facilitating an improved understanding of functions of membrane-coupled proteins. Our work underscores the importance of selecting key embedding features to enhance predictive performance and reduce computational footprint of sequence-based predictors of protein functions. The web server for the pLMMoRF predictor and the predictions for human proteins are freely available at https://plmmorf.hegelab.org."

However, little is known about what factors negatively influence intrinsic capacity among people with HIV (PWH).\n\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional study.\n\nMETHOD: Participants included PWH [≥35 years and on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for a minimum of 12 months] attending HIV care in University Malaya Medical Centre. Intrinsic capacity scores were computed based on five key domains (sensory, mobility, cognition, vitality, and mood). Pareto analyses were performed to determine the domains impaired in the majority of participants, and multivariable linear regression to explore factors associated with low intrinsic capacity.\n\nRESULTS: The median age in the 202 PWH were 50 years [interquartile range (IQR): 44-57 years] and median intrinsic capacity score was 5.60 (IQR: 4.80-5.80, max 6). Deficits in vitality were observed in 52.8% of participants, followed by cognition (18.8%) and mood (18.1%). Factors associated with low intrinsic capacity scores after adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors included multimorbidity [-0.130, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.181, -0.079, P  = 0.000] and polypharmacy (-0.077, 95% CI: -0.119, -0.036, P  = 0.000), metabolic syndrome (-0.360, 95% CI: -0.568, -0.153, P  = 0.001), renal disease (-0.450, 95% CI: -0.871, -0.029, P  = 0.036) and diabetes (-0.337, 95% CI: -0.590, -0.085, P  = 0.009), social isolation (0.021, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.039, P  = 0.025), loneliness (-0.063, 95% CI: -0.114, -0.013, P  = 0.014) and high high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (-0.028, 95% CI: -0.054, -0.002, P  = 0.034).\n\nCONCLUSION: Poor social connectedness and multimorbidity, particularly metabolic syndrome and renal disease, are significant risk factors for low intrinsic capacity scores among PWH in our setting.

NDs are characterized by cognitive and motor decline, resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Currently, there is no cure for NDs. Gene and RNA editing therapies offer new possibilities for addressing NDs. Gene editing involves modifying mutant genes associated with NDs, while RNA editing can directly modify RNA molecules to regulate the protein translation process, potentially influencing the expression of genes related to NDs. In this review, we examined the historical evolution, mechanisms of action, applications in NDs, advantages and disadvantages, as well as ethical and safety considerations of gene and RNA editing. While gene and RNA editing technologies hold promise for treating NDs, further research and development are needed to address safety, efficacy, and treatment timing issues, ultimately offering improved treatment options for ND patients. Our review provides valuable insights for future gene and RNA editing applications in ND treatment."

The most severe outcomes of CHIKF, including mortality, are frequently observed in individuals with comorbidities diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to investigate how varying glucose concentrations influence CHIKV infection.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in normal glucose (NG - 5.5 mM glucose) or high glucose (HG - 25 mM glucose) to mimic normoglycemia and hyperglycemia conditions. Cells were infected with CHIKV and changes in host glucose metabolism were evaluated. Metabolic flux, viral replication, and cellular insulin sensitivity were assessed through biochemical, molecular analyses and metabolomics.\n\nKEY FINDINGS: CHIKV infection modulates host cell metabolism in a glucose-dependent manner. Under NG conditions, the virus regulates glucose metabolism to support replication and virion production. In contrast, HG environments enhance viral replication, exploiting the altered metabolic landscape. Notably, CHIKV restores insulin sensitivity in HG conditions, leading to increased glucose uptake. It also promotes anaplerotic reactions by diverting tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates toward amino acid synthesis and upregulates glycolytic flux into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP).\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide mechanistic insight into how hyperglycemia associated with DM can exacerbate CHIKV pathogenesis. The virus's ability to hijack and redirect host metabolic processes in high glucose environments may underline the worsened disease severity observed in diabetic patients. Understanding these interactions could inform targeted therapeutic strategies for managing CHIKF in individuals with metabolic comorbidities."

However, due to species-specific differences in metabolism, lifespan, and dietary composition, no single model could fully recapitulate the onset and progression of human MASH. Therefore, a detailed transcriptomic reference is urgently needed to better guide model selection and experimental design.\n\nMETHODS: We established three murine MASH models: HFD, MCD and CDA-HFD. Physiological and pathological features were systematically evaluated and compared across models. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed, and the resulting data were integrated with transcriptomic profiles from CCl₄-induced models and human MASH datasets, with a focus on metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular signaling pathways.\n\nKEY FINDINGS: The CDA-HFD and CCl₄ models closely resembled human MASH in inflammation and fibrosis but disrupted key metabolic pathways. Conversely, the HFD model mirrored metabolic abnormalities but lacked severe inflammation and fibrosis. Immunoinfiltration and single-cell analyses revealed that macrophages dominate the inflammatory process, with activation of PPAR signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling, and phagocytosis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: To balance metabolic and pathological fidelity without relying on genetic or toxin means, a combination of the CDA-HFD model with either HFD or WD is recommended as a robust and practical strategy for MASH research."

Tryptophan (Trp) not only acts as a nutrient enhancer but also plays a critical role in the balance between host immune tolerance and gut microbiota maintenance. Both endogenous and bacterial metabolites of Trp, exert significant effects on gut microbial composition, microbial metabolism, the host immunity and the host-microbiome interface. Trp metabolites regulate host immunity by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), thereby contributing to immune homeostasis. Among Trp metabolites, AhR ligands include endogenous metabolites (such as kynurenine), and bacterial metabolites (such as indole and its derivatives). Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between Trp metabolism and 14 key microbiota, encompassing fungi (e.g., Candida albicans, Aspergillus), bacteria (e.g., Ruminococcus gnavus, Bacteroides, Prevotella copri, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, lactobacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter. Pylori), and viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus). This review clarifies how the gut microbiota regulates Trp metabolism and uncovers the underlying mechanisms of these interactions. And increased mechanistic insight into how the microbiota modulate the host immune system through Trp metabolism may allow for the identification of innovative therapies that are specifically designed to target Trp absorption, Trp metabolites, the gut microbiota, or interactions between Trp and gut microbiota to treat both intestinal and extra-intestinal inflammation as well as microbial infections."

Research outside of sport suggests that the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, immune, anabolic, and cardiovascular systems, in particular, may be affected. However, few studies have explored the relationship between burnout and biomarkers of these systems in athletes. Consequently, the aim of the present multidisciplinary study was to explore the relationship between athlete burnout and acute and chronic biomarkers using a longitudinal N-of-1 design. Following a pre-registered protocol with open data, code, and materials, in two athletes, we examined burnout and acute salivary biomarkers (cortisol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate [DHEA-S], secretory Immunoglobulin A [sIgA], and C-reactive protein) in 12 samples over six months. In another two athletes, we examined burnout and chronic biomarkers from hair and blood (hair cortisol, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c], triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and DNA methylation in the BDNF, SLC6A4, and NR3C1 genes) in six samples over 12 months. Dynamic regression modelling showed that burnout symptoms predicted decreased testosterone and developed simultaneously with decreases in DHEA-S and sIgA. Visual analyses suggested that burnout symptoms also developed in conjunction with increases in HbA1c and SLC6A4 methylation and preceded increases in hair cortisol and BDNF methylation. Our findings provide a preliminary \"physiological fingerprint\" that could help explain athlete burnout development and consequences which can be used to guide future theory and research in this area."

Therefore, present study investigated the potential of NMR-based metabolomics for identifying non-invasive biomarkers for assessing treatment response. Comprehensive metabolic profiling of 120 biological samples comprising of small intestinal mucosal biopsies, blood plasmas and urines collected at two time points (before and after 6-8 months of GFD) from CeD patients (n = 20) was carried out using proton NMR spectroscopy. The levels of arginine glutamate, and glutamine were significantly reduced in both intestinal mucosa and blood plasma of CeD patients after GFD compared to their baseline values. These amino acids play an important role in intestinal energy metabolism, and alleviating inflammation, thereby contributing to healing mechanisms of small intestinal mucosa, following GFD. A logistic regression statistical model based on the combination of the above three blood plasma metabolites demonstrated AUC of 0.980, Youden index 0.900 with a sensitivity and a specificity of 90 % and 100 % for monitoring treatment response in CeD patients after GFD.

These properties have driven innovative applications, positioning AMPs as promising contributors to advancements in various industrial sectors. This review evaluates the multifaceted nature of AMPs and their biotechnological applications in underexplored sectors. In the food industry, the application of AMPs helps to suppress the growth of microorganisms, thereby decreasing foodborne illnesses, minimizing food waste, and prolonging the shelf life of products. In animal husbandry and aquaculture, incorporating AMPs into the diet reduces the load of pathogenic microorganisms and enhances growth performance and survival rates. In agriculture, AMPs provide an alternative to decrease the use of chemical pesticides and antibiotics.

Recent findings provide new insights into the roles of CL-modulating proteins as critical determinants of podocyte function in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We previously demonstrated that Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) is a compelling target inhibiting Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced lipid dysregulation in podocytes. However, whether Sirt6 regulates podocyte CL metabolism is unknown.\n\nMETHODS: Renal biopsy specimens of patients with hypertensive nephropathy (HN) were used in this study. Podocyte Sirt6-specific knockout mice were generated using the Cre-loxP system. The effect of Sirt6 on mitochondrial CL metabolism, especially the peroxidation and hydrolysis of CL, was investigated in Ang II-infusion mice and Ang II-induced cultured podocytes.\n\nRESULTS: Sirt6 and outer mitochondrial membrane protein phospholipase D family member 6 (PLD6) were decreased in the glomeruli of patients with HN. Ang II downregulated Sirt6 and PLD6 expression in podocytes in vitro and in vivo. Podocyte-specific deletion of Sirt6 exacerbated lipid droplets formation, CL accumulation and peroxidation, aggravated Ang II-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. Mechanically, Sirt6 maintained podocyte CL homeostasis, at least in part through PLD6 signaling-mediated CL metabolism. In addition, cardiolipin antioxidant Szeto-Schiller Peptide 31 (SS-31) treatment inhibited Ang II-induced lipid accumulation and CL peroxidation in podocytes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on Sirt6's regulatory mechanisms on podocyte CL metabolism and suggest exploiting the Sirt6-PLD6 axis as a potential therapeutic target for protecting against lipid nephrotoxicity."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is highly prevalent among hospitalized children, but there is no treatment. Impaired de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis measured via elevation of the urine quinolinic acid-to-tryptophan ratio (uQ:T) is a feature of AKI that has been described in preclinical models and humans with AKI. Small prospective trials to restore NAD+ abundance with NAD+ precursor supplementation have shown promise in the prevention and treatment of AKI. It is not known whether pediatric patients also develop suppression of NAD+ biosynthesis during AKI, but such information will be critical before children can be included in NAD+ -based clinical trials to treat or prevent AKI.\n\nMETHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was performed on convenience urine samples from children hospitalized in a tertiary care children's hospital. Samples were split into five groups: outpatient controls, floor controls, ICU controls, floor AKI, and ICU AKI. Clinical data were collected from the medical record, and metabolites were measured using targeted mass spectrometry. Patients with AKI were compared to their respective controls. A multivariate linear regression was used to assess whether demographic variables were independently associated with uQ:T, and odds of AKI were assessed in serial uQ:T tertiles using multivariate logistic regression models that adjusted for patient variables.\n\nRESULTS: Sixty-nine control patients (39 outpatient, 10 floor, and 20 ICU controls) and 22 AKI patients (12 floor and 10 ICU) were enrolled. uQ:T was elevated in patients with AKI compared to their respective controls. No demographic variables were independently associated with uQ:T, and when adjusting for patient demographic and clinical variables, the odds of AKI increased serially with uQ:T tertile.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated uQ:T is a feature of pediatric AKI. The present results warrant further exploration in observational and potentially interventional studies with NAD+ precursor therapies."

The evaluation of postprandial responses allows for a comprehensive assessment of metabolism and biomarkers that may predispose to chronic disease risk. By applying a dietary challenge consisting of the ingestion of a liquid, energy-dense mixed meal, followed by blood sampling over a 6-hour period, we conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the postprandial metabolism in postmenopausal women (PM) aged 50-70 years and women of reproductive age (RA) aged 20 and 40 years. PM body weight was only 10% higher than RA, but the first displayed twice as much (more than 20%) intrabdominal adipose tissue. PM also displayed elevated fasting and postprandial glycemia (∼20%) and lipidemia compared to RA. Differences were also observed in the postprandial levels of lactate. Both groups displayed a similar increase in white blood cell count during the challenge, despite large differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene expression in both fasting and postprandial states, suggesting a pro-inflammatory state and HIF-α and glycolytic pathway activation in PM. Plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were increased in PM (37 and 52%, respectively). Postprandial plasma levels of incretins presented different kinetics to each group. Our findings reveal that PM display a proinflammatory signature and markers of metabolic deterioration after a 12-h fasting and in the postprandial period when compared to RA."

It is crucial to have a good understanding of PLT adhesion forces under magneto-thermal conditions to prevent thrombosis formation and improve the efficiency of thrombolytic treatment. The effects of temperature, non-thermal magnetic field (MF) exposure, and combined magneto-thermal conditions on the interaction forces between PLT and various materials (PLT-PLT, PLT-HUVEC, PLT-collagen, and PLT-RBC) were measured using a modified atomic force microscope. The viscoelastic modulus and morphology of PLTs were assessed by atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscopy, and the concentrations of GPIIb/IIIa glycoproteins on the PLT surface and reactive oxygen species within PLTs were quantified to elucidate the mechanisms driving PLT adhesion changes induced by external fields. The results indicate that the interaction forces for all pairs peak at 37 °C and decrease with rising temperatures. High temperatures (>37 °C) inhibit PLT interactions by reducing GPIIb/IIIa receptor activity, thereby lowering thrombosis risk. At 47 °C, PLTs rupture into small spherical vesicles, with significant activity reduction and functional damage. Moreover, MF strength positively correlates with the interaction forces of all pairs at a given temperature, with the most pronounced effect observed in PLT-PLT interactions. Elevated MF strength enhances PLT interaction forces by activating reactive oxygen species and GPIIb/IIIa, as well as increasing the viscoelasticity of the PLT membrane. Additionally, the presence of an MF delays PLT morphological transformation at temperatures exceeding 37 °C."

    "text": "Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease that poses a significant threat to animal health worldwide. In addition, climate change and the risk of human-to-human transmission through blood transfusion have made babesiosis an emerging disease in humans. Babesiosis is caused by the intraerythrocytic development of protozoan parasites from the genus Babesia, which belongs to the apicomplexan phylum that notably includes the more-widely studied causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum. Of the several hundred Babesia species identified so far, only a few are known to infect humans, with B. microti being the most prevalent and responsible for most of the clinical cases reported to date. There is no licensed vaccine for B. microti, and the development of a reliable serological diagnostic test would contribute to ensuring the safety of blood transfusions. The identification and characterization of parasite surface proteins are important steps in achieving this aim. One such protein is the GPI-anchored Major Surface Antigen BmSA1 (also known as BmGPI12), which is expressed at high levels at the surface of the merozoite. We present here the high-resolution solution structure of the 28 kDa structured core of BmSA1 (∆∆BmSA1) obtained through NMR spectroscopy. The structure of BmSA1 appears unrelated to the previously published structures of the major surface antigens of B. divergens (Bd37) or of B. canis (Bc28.1), which are thought to play a similar role in parasite invasion. We also define the erythrocyte binding function of ∆∆BmSA1, using NMR spectroscopy to map the binding interface. Finally, we used bioinformatic tools to map the potential epitopes of antibodies at the surface of the structured core of BmSA1."

Emerging evidence from molecular nutrition research reveals that certain dietary nutrients can enhance intestinal vitamin D absorption through targeted modulation of lipid transport pathways. Despite significant advancements in vitamin D delivery systems demonstrating excellent intestinal mucoadhesion and in vitro bioaccessibility, their clinical translation remains limited by suboptimal in vivo bioavailability. To address this critical challenge, we propose an innovative synergistic nutrient absorption strategy that establishes precise coordination among three key elements: dietary nutrient composition, transport protein regulation, and intestinal absorption optimization. This comprehensive review systematically examines: (1) The molecular mechanisms governing transintestinal vitamin D transport and physiological modulation of protein-mediated absorption pathways; (2) The regulatory effects of dietary components on vitamin D absorption efficiency through protein pathway modulation, proposing a novel \"nutrient-transporter-vitamin D axis\" strategy integrating cutting-edge carrier technologies; (3) Future perspectives for developing functionalized vitamin D delivery systems. The proposed paradigm shift, combining nutrient-mediated transport enhancement with advanced carrier engineering, represents a transformative approach to overcome current limitations in oral vitamin D delivery. This dual-modulation strategy synergistically improves intestinal absorption and systemic bioavailability through simultaneous optimization of biological transport mechanisms and pharmaceutical delivery parameters, offering new possibilities for precision nutrition interventions."

This study aimed to investigate the association between the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and PPD in Chinese women, and explore whether inflammatory cytokines mediate this association.\n\nMETHODS: The study recruited 2038 participants and collected data from them. The Chinese version of the Self-Rating Depression Scale was used to assess postpartum depressive symptoms, and the DII scores were evaluated using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). To ensure balanced groups, researchers performed propensity score matching. From the matched participants, 126 blood samples were collected to determine serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. Researchers used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) between the DII tertiles, inflammatory markers, and PPD. Finally, researchers conducted a mediation analysis using the bootstrap method to examine the relationship between DII, inflammation, and PPD.\n\nRESULTS: Among 2038 participants, 742 (36.4 %) participants were identified as having PPD symptoms. The higher DII scores were associated with PPD, and its significance still exists after a series of factors were adjusted (T2 vs T1: OR = 1.24, 95 % CI: 0.99, 1.55, P > 0.05; T3 vs T1: OR = 1.33, 95 % CI: 1.06, 1.66, P < 0.05). In addition, a higher level of CRP was associated with increased odds of PPD (OR = 1.34, 95 % CI: 1.13, 1.59, P < 0.05). The mediation analysis showed that a direct effect of DII on PPD persisted, and CRP mediated the relationship between DII and PPD.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A higher DII was associated with an increased risk of PPD in Chinese women. The present finding reinforces the importance of limiting pro-inflammatory food consumed and adopting an anti-inflammatory diet to decrease the risk of PPD."

We used the commercially available HMOs lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) as donor and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) as acceptor for the synthesis of para-lacto-N-hexaose (pLNH). To improve the transglycosylation performance of LnbX (18 % molar yield), we designed 14 single mutants using two different strategies: 1) conservative substitution of conserved residues in the active site, and 2) shielding of the active site by large, hydrophobic residues. Protein engineering improved pLNH yield 1.5-fold as compared to the wild type (to 27 %). More than a 3-fold increase was obtained when optimizing the reaction conditions using the best variant, LnbX D416N, by an experimental design including reaction temperature, pH, donor substrate concentration, acceptor-to-donor (A/D) ratio, and enzyme concentration. Higher LNT concentrations and A/D ratios led to increased pLNH yields, and a high A/D ratio also increased the proportion of pLNH among the reaction products. The maximum molar yield of 57 % was obtained after 3 h of reaction at 100 mM LNT, 500 mM LNnT, 1 μM enzyme, 35 °C and pH 6.5. The LnbX D416N enzyme, which can use lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFP-III) as an alternative acceptor substrate, is active and stable at industrially relevant ranges of pH and temperature. The enzyme may thus be useful for diversification of the industrially available HMO portfolio."

This article presents a dry-lab/classroom-ready dataset and teaching approach that allows students to analyze the endocrine regulation of metabolism following the consumption of foods predominantly composed of fat, protein, or carbohydrates. By examining real data on blood glucose and insulin responses, students gain a deeper understanding of how macronutrient intake influences metabolic pathways. A pilot set of data (originally collected with appropriate ethical approval) is provided, showing blood glucose and insulin levels from 15 participants randomly assigned to consume a food primarily composed of either fat, protein, or carbohydrates. This dataset is intended for in-class data analysis, where students predict and interpret changes in blood glucose and insulin using statistical tests. Postprandial glucose and insulin levels increased most dramatically after carbohydrate intake, whereas protein and fat intake produced more modest increases with minimal insulin changes. These findings align with expected endocrine responses and provide a rich dataset for student exploration of metabolic regulation. Shifting from direct laboratory work to data-driven classroom analysis offers an accessible way to teach endocrine metabolism. By using real-world data, students can practice experimental design skills, interpret statistical findings, and better understand how diet influences blood glucose and insulin levels."

A progressive reduction in gluten content and increased starch granule exposure were observed in NPN with increasing highland barley incorporation, while PN maintained structural integrity with minimal starch granule exposure and gluten disruption. This might be attributed to crystallinity reduction (14.3 % → 7.1 %) and short-range ordered structure disruption (0.85 → 0.82) in PN, facilitating denser starch network and V-type complex formation. The protein secondary structure in PN shifted from α-helix to β-sheet, resulting in more SS bonds. The hardness, springiness and chewiness of PN70 were 29.51 %, 71.95 % and 99.64 % higher than those of NPN70.

    "text": "Mitochondria are essential organelles for cellular function and have become a broad field of study. In cardio-renal diseases, it has been established that mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary mechanism leading to these pathologies. Under stress, mitochondria can develop stress response mechanisms to maintain mitochondrial quality control (MQC) and functions. In contrast, the perturbation of these mechanisms has been associated with the pathogenesis of several diseases. Thus, targeting specific pathways within MQC could offer a therapeutic avenue for protecting mitochondrial integrity. However, the mechanisms related to MQC and mitochondrial stress signaling in the cardio-renal axis have been poorly explored. The primary limitations include the lack of reproducibility in the experimental models of cardio-renal disease, the incomplete knowledge of molecules that generate bidirectional damage, and the temporality of the study models. Therefore, we believe that integration of all of those limitations, along with recent advances in MQC mechanisms (i.e., mitophagy), stress signaling pathways (e.g., integrated stress response, mitochondrial unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial protein import), associated pharmacology, and targeted therapeutic approaches could reveal what the deregulation of these mechanisms is like and provide ideas for generating strategies that seek to avoid the progression of cardio-renal diseases."

These methods were assessed using unbiased datasets that include C1, C2h, C2v, and C3 test sets. Ultimately, we integrated these five methodologies into a unified model for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between coronaviruses and human proteins. Our final model demonstrates relatively better performance, particularly with the C2v and C3 test sets, which are frequently used datasets in practical applications. Based on this model, we further established a high-confidence PPI network between coronaviruses and humans, consisting of 18,012 interactions between 3843 human proteins and 129 coronavirus proteins. The reliability of our predictions was further validated through the current knowledge framework and network analysis. This study is anticipated to enhance mechanistic understanding of the coronavirus-human relationship a while facilitating the rediscovery of antiviral drug targets.

Despite its effective performance, ACN poses toxicity risks to humans and has adverse effects on environmental sustainability. In the current work, we developed a novel alcohol-based solvent system for peptide mapping by systematic evaluation of parameters such as organic eluent composition, solvent gradient, flow rate, and column temperature. We compared the chromatographic performance and MS response of peptides between the standard (ACN based) and the new developed solvent systems (EtOH/IPA based). The results of our study show that the EtOH/IPA based solvent system improves selectivity factor (α) and resolution (R), while the standard ACN based solvent system provides a lower peak width and hence a higher peak height. The majority of the analysed peptides exhibited shorter retention times, whereas hydrophobic peptides eluted later when using the EtOH/IPA solvent system. Several critical quality attributes (CQA) of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) were successfully characterized by this method without compromising the chromatographic separations and MS response of the peptides. Furthermore, the suitability of the new approach for LC-UV assessment of a mAb as part of an identity test of therapeutic proteins was demonstrated. Our proposed approach, which prioritizes safety, non-toxicity, and compatibility with all LC-MS instruments, offers significant support to a broad community of academic and biopharmaceutical scientists in their pursuit of a bottom-up green strategy."

The three ICM is tailored to specific patient needs and diagnostic contexts. However, excessive doses of ICM may induce adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity. Accurate measurement of ICM concentration is essential for reducing renal burden and ensuring patient safety. Current methods for quantifying ICM are often limited to single-analyte detection (especially iohexol), which is inefficient for clinical practice. Therefore, this method aims to develop and validate a rapid, generic LC-MS/MS method for simultaneously quantifying iohexol, iopromide, and iodixanol in human plasma to improve patient management and prognosis. An LC-MS/MS-based approach was established utilizing an C18 column coupled with a Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Sample preparation involved protein precipitation, while chromatographic separation was achieved using acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid in water. The developed LC-MS/MS method achieved satisfactory separation of the three ICM within 1.5 min. Calibration curves for iohexol, iopromide, and iodixanol showed good linearity in 5.00-5000, 5.00-5000 and 10.0 ∼ 10000 µg/mL, respectively. The method was effectively applied to analyze 71 plasma samples from 9 patients, highlighting its clinical utility. A rapid and generic LC-MS/MS method streamlines sample preparation and standardizes laboratory workflows, making it suitable for clinical bio-samples."

Multivariable-adjusted age-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between tea consumption and T2D risk.\n\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 14.0 years, 16,100 incident cases of T2D were documented. Greater tea consumption was associated with a modestly reduced risk of T2D. Compared with no tea consumption, the HR (95% CI) of T2D was 0.93 (0.89, 0.98), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.90) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.92) for tea consumption of 2 to 3, 4 to 5, or 6+ cups per day, respectively (P for trend < 0.0001). The observed inverse association between tea consumption and T2D risk was generally consistent across cohort subgroups, including groups with different genetic susceptibility to T2D (P for interaction = 0.64). Mediation analyses estimated that 49.7% (95% CI: 37.1%, 62.4%), 11.2% (95% CI: 4.2%, 26.3%), 3.6% (95% CI: 1.5%, 8.5%), 5.3% (95% CI: 2.6%, 10.4%), and 2.8% (95% CI: 0.8%, 9.6%) of the inverse tea association may be effected through BMI, waist-hip ratio, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and C-reactive protein, respectively. On the other hand, consumption of artificially sweetened tea was positively related to risk of T2D.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Greater tea consumption was associated with decreased risk of T2D, independent of other risk factors and genetic predisposition. In contrast, consumption of artificially sweetened tea was positively associated with risk of T2D. Our findings provide evidence relevant to the primary prevention of T2D, supporting the potential of tea consumption as a component of a healthy diet."

Among these approaches, microfluidic-based Heart-on-a-chip (HOC) models are promising, as they enable the engineering of miniaturized, physiologically relevant in vitro cardiac tissues with precise control over cellular constituents and tissue architecture. Despite significant advancements, previously reported HOC models often lack the electroconductivity features of the native human myocardium. In this study, we developed a 3D electroconductive HOC (referred to as eHOC) model through the co-culture of isogenic hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (hiCFs), embedded within an electroconductive hydrogel scaffold in a microfluidic-based chip system. Functional and gene expression analyses demonstrated that, compared to non-conductive HOC, the eHOC model exhibited enhanced contractile functionality, improved calcium transients, and increased expression of structural and calcium handling genes. The eHOC model was further leveraged to investigate the underlying electroconduction-induced pathway(s) associated with cardiac tissue development through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Notably, scRNA-seq analyses revealed a significant downregulation of a set of cardiac genes, associated with the fetal stage of heart development, as well as upregulation of sarcomere- and conduction-related genes within the eHOC model. Additionally, upregulation of the cardiac muscle contraction and motor protein pathways were observed in the eHOC model, consistent with enhanced contractile functionality of the engineered cardiac tissues. Comparison of scRNA-seq data from the 3D eHOC model with published datasets of adult human hearts demonstrated a similar expression pattern of fetal- and adult-like cardiac genes. Overall, this study provides a unique eHOC model with improved biomimcry and organotypic features, which could be potentially used for drug testing and discovery, as well as disease modeling applications."

Subsequently, the patient developed acute vision loss, severe hypertension, and acute kidney injury with significantly worsening skin lesions. Ultimately, the patient deteriorated rapidly and succumbed. At autopsy, cutaneous calciphylaxis was confirmed, affecting over 50% of body surface area as well as widespread organ involvement by visceral calciphylaxis, most strikingly in the heart and lungs.

Traditional drug discovery involves pharmacologists manually screening drug molecules against protein targets, focusing on binding within protein cavities. However, this manual process is slow and inherently limited. Given these constraints, the use of deep learning techniques to predict drug-target interaction (DTI) affinities is both significant and promising for future applications. This paper introduces an innovative deep learning architecture designed to enhance the prediction of DTI affinities. The model ingeniously combines graph neural networks, pre-trained large-scale protein models, and attention mechanisms to improve performance. In this framework, molecular structures are represented as graphs and processed through graph neural networks and multiscale convolutional networks to facilitate feature extraction. Simultaneously, protein sequences are encoded using pre-trained ESM-2 large models and processed with bidirectional long short-term memory networks. Subsequently, the molecular and protein embeddings derived from these processes are integrated within a fusion module to compute affinity scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing methods on two publicly available datasets."

Efficient targeted delivery properties of toxin proteins themselves provide important insights into the design of novel drug delivery systems. Inspired by the natural targeting properties of the plant-derived type I ribosome-inactivating protein (RIPs) MAP30, we engineered a detoxified carrier, MAP30ER, through site-directed mutagenesis of key enzymatic residues (E158A/R161A). This variant retained its cell-binding capability while exhibiting significantly reduced cytotoxicity. ELISA and molecular docking identified EGFR as the primary functional receptor of MAP30, and flow cytometry confirmed a 3-fold higher binding affinity of MAP30 to EGFR-high tumor cells (A431) compared to EGFR-low cells (HeLa). To address endosomal entrapment, we screened triterpenoid saponins and found that Saikosaponin A (SSA) enhanced the endosomal escape efficiency of MAP30ER by inducing vesicle membrane disruption. When applied to deliver Apoptin (a apoptosis-inducing protein), the MAP30ER-SSA system elevated tumor cell killing efficacy from 65 % to 90 % upon SSA co-treatment, and Western blot confirmed that it induced apoptosis through activation of caspase-3/9 and cleavage of PARP1. Furthermore, we extended antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology to the MAP30ER platform, constructing a MAP30ER-MMAE conjugate that achieved targeted delivery to A431 cells with negligible toxicity to normal cells. This study establishes a novel paradigm for engineering plant-derived RIPs and provides a multifunctional delivery platform with targeting specificity, safety, and versatility, offering innovative solutions to overcome drug delivery challenges in cancer therapy."

This study explores the therapeutic potential of snail mucus derived from snails fed different concentrations of carob (SSCS) and compares its efficacy to aqueous carob extracts (AECS). Both SSCS and AECS are rich in bioactive compounds with potential anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and tissue-regenerative effects.\n\nRESULTS: Snail mucus was found to be rich in collagen and allantoin, which are crucial for tissue repair and cell regeneration, whereas carob extracts contained high levels of phenolics, tannins and flavonoids, contributing to their antioxidant properties. In a rat model of acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis, pretreatment with SSCS, AECS or sulfasalazine significantly alleviated colonic damage. The SSCS30% group exhibited the strongest protective effects, comparable to sulfasalazine, in reducing mucosal injury, inflammation and immune activation. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that SSCS30% effectively decreased systemic inflammation markers (CRP), pancreatic stress indicators (amylase) and liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT, ALP), while enhancing antioxidant defenses and preserving colonic sulfhydryl content.\n\nCONCLUSION: These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of snail mucus, particularly from snails fed a 30% carob-enriched diet, as a promising natural therapy for IBD. Its potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and tissue-regenerative properties suggest that the use of SSCS30% could serve as an innovative approach for managing ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory disorders. These findings suggest that carob-enriched snail mucus could serve as a complementary therapy for ulcerative colitis patients, though clinical validation remains necessary. While these preclinical results are promising, further clinical studies are needed to validate the therapeutic potential of this natural combination in human ulcerative colitis. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

This reduction contributes to decreased formation of undesirable odor substances while positively influencing flavor profiles. These findings suggest that sous vide cooking technology can effectively enhance both the texture and flavor profile of yellowfin tuna."

    "text": "Starch is the major component of pulse cotyledons and a primary energy source in the human diet. Its digestion is influenced by intrinsic structure and processing-induced changes at cellular level. This study investigated the effects of monovalent, divalent, and trivalent salts on cell-wall structure and in vitro digestion properties of intracellular starch. Whole peas were soaked in salt-solutions with pH ranging from highly-acidic (1.5-4.5) to alkaline (10-11) and cooked cotyledon cells were isolated. Alkaline salt treatment enhanced water absorption, cell separation, yield, starch digestion, and fluorescence, while reduced particle size, galacturonic acid, protein content, and gelatinization temperatures compared to slightly-acidic salt treatments. In contrast, highly-acidic salt treatments caused slight cell rupture, reduced water absorption, yield, and nutritional content but increased starch crystallinity, gelatinization temperatures, and digestion with increased fluorescence. These findings show that salt-induced pH modulation can regulate starch digestion, providing insights into dietary management and metabolic health."

Twenty-four phenolic compounds were released, with pomegranate peel maintaining higher bioactivity than chestnut and walnut peels. In vitro colonic fermentation with urolithin A-producing microbiota revealed that pomegranate peel stimulated butyrate synthesis (11.94 mM) and urolithin A production (6.31 μM), highlighting the prebiotic role of ellagic acid. Gut microbiota modulation by pomegranate peel increased Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium (a potential key for ellagic acid conversion) while suppressing Alistipes. Functional analyses confirmed its effect on carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. In contrast, chestnut and walnut peels exhibited lower bioactivity and microbial selectivity. These findings positioned pomegranate peel as a superior ingredient for gut health and microbial metabolism optimization, offering targeted nutritional benefits over conventional byproducts."

Although ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) plays a critical role in AKI pathogenesis, our understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes remains incomplete, thereby impeding the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Mitochondrial dysfunction, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolic disruption, and inflammatory responses are central to AKI progression; however, their mechanistic links are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that IRI significantly reduces the TCA cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB), leading to succinate accumulation in kidneys. SDHB overexpression markedly ameliorates mitochondrial damage and inflammation in tubular epithelial cells (TECs) both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, succinate directly interacts with prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2) at the tyrosine-329 (TYR-329) site, inhibiting its activity, thereby hyperactivating the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway and exacerbating immune-inflammatory responses in AKI. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how TCA cycle disruptions and HIF-1α interactions drive renal inflammation, suggesting SDHB as a potential therapeutic target for AKI."

Here, we identified ‌lncRNA-gm33782‌ as a potentially pathogenic mediator in AKI due to its strongly upregulated expression in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and cisplatin (Cis) induced AKI mouse models. Interestingly, in Cis-AKI model, renal-specific knockdown of ‌lncRNA-gm33782 via in vivo electroporation significantly attenuated tubular injury and macrophage infiltration. RNA-seq of ‌lncRNA-gm33782 overexpressed tubular epithelial cells (TECs) revealed ‌Ccl5‌ as the top upregulated chemokine, while protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis linked Ccl5 to NF-κB activation. Mechanistically, conditioned media from ‌lncRNA-gm33782-overexpressed TECs promoted pro-inflammatory responses in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), whereas silencing Ccl5 in TECs attenuated macrophage inflammation. Notably, co-culture of lncRNA-gm33782 overexpressed TECs with BMDMs exacerbated both macrophage M1 polarization and tubular injury marker - Tim-1, establishing a feedforward loop of renal damage. Rescue experiments demonstrated that simultaneous overexpression of lncRNA-gm33782 and knockdown of Ccl5 reversed macrophage-driven inflammation and tubular injury, indicating that Ccl5 serves as the key effector for lncRNA-gm33782-mediated macrophage inflammation and its feedback-driven tubular injury. These findings reveal that tubular-derived lncRNA-gm33782 drives AKI progression by activating the Ccl5/NF-κB pathway to promote M1 macrophage polarization, highlighting lncRNA-gm33782 as a potential therapeutic target for immune modulation in AKI."

ISGylation is widely involved in the innate immune activation and IFN-I production. Here, we discovered that in patients with LN and pristane-induced model mouse the staining of HERC5, a E3 protein ligase in ISGylation, was markedly elevated in renal glomerulus and associated with podocyte injury. Knockdown of HERC5 in Human podocyte cells significantly decreased the transcription level of Ifn-b1 and subsequently pro-inflammatory factors Tnf-α, Il-6, and Cxcl10, while increasing anti-inflammatory factor Il-10 levels, and reduced podocyte injury induced by LN plasma or IFN-β. Conversely, overexpression of HERC5 reversed the above results, that increased IFN-β generation and excessive activation, and induced podocyte injury. Mechanistically, HERC5 interacts with and facilitates the ISGylation of IRF3, preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This interaction stabilizes IRF3, enhancing its activity and leading to sustained IFN-β production and inflammation. In conclusion, our study identifies HERC5 as a key regulator in LN, promoting IRF3 activation and driving sustained IFN-β production and overactivation. This process induces an inflammatory phenotype in podocytes, contributing to their self-injury."

This study aimed to elucidate the role of circular RNA circLRCH3 in LN and to clarify its underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\nMETHODS: The expression of circLRCH3 was evaluated in renal tissues and serum samples from LN patients, as well as in human podocyte cells (HPCs) treated with LN-derived immunoglobulin G (LN-IgG). The functional significance of circLRCH3 was examined in vitro and in vivo through its knockdown in LN-IgG-induced HPCs and MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice, respectively. Interactions among circLRCH3, fused in sarcoma (FUS), and interferon-induced protein 35 (IFI35) were explored using RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pulldown assays. Podocyte pyroptosis and autophagy were analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence.\n\nRESULTS: circLRCH3 was significantly upregulated in both LN patient samples and LN-IgG-induced HPCs. Silencing circLRCH3 in MRL/lpr mice attenuated renal pathological damage and improved renal function. In HPCs, circLRCH3 knockdown suppressed pyroptosis, enhanced autophagy, and increased cell viability. Mechanistically, circLRCH3 was found to bind to FUS, thereby stabilizing IFI35 mRNA. This interaction inhibited autophagy and exacerbated pyroptosis in podocytes.\n\nCONCLUSION: circLRCH3 is upregulated in LN and contributes to podocyte injury by inhibiting autophagy and promoting pyroptosis through the FUS-IFI35 pathway. Thus, targeting circLRCH3 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for LN."

    "text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic degenerative joint disease, characterized by osteophyte formation and cartilage degeneration. A growing number of studies have found that nod-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated chondrocyte pyroptosis plays a crucial role in the development of OA. Acetyl zingerone (AZ) is a small molecule compound, chemically synthesized to retain the key functional properties of curcumin and zingerone, while exhibiting enhanced anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-aging effects. Previous studies in our group have found an inhibitory effect on ferroptosis in AZ osteoarthritis. However, its specific mechanism of action has not been fully explained. Therefore, we further delved into whether AZ could alleviate OA in mice by affecting mitophagy and pyroptosis. In an in vitro study, we observed that AZ alleviated LPS + ATP-induced pyroptosis in chondrocytes and inhibited the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key factor in pyroptosis. Moreover, by using the mitophagy activators Resveratrol, the autophagy lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and siPINK1 to knock down PINK1, we demonstrated that AZ promoted PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. AZ enhanced PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, facilitating the clearance of damaged mitochondria, thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This cascade mitigated chondrocyte pyroptosis and promoted collagen synthesis. Moreover, AZ demonstrated a comparable pro-regenerative effect on the extracellular matrix to that observed with the standard osteoarthritis treatment, rapamycin. In animal experiments, intra-articular administration of AZ similarly promoted mitophagy and inhibited chondrocyte pyroptosis, alleviating osteoid formation and cartilage damage. Collectively, these findings suggest that AZ may mitigate OA progression by activating mitophagy and attenuating pyroptosis, highlighting its potential as a preventive therapeutic approach for OA."

The clinical value of the five biomarkers and 5 MP in the early diagnosis from healthy control, benign gastric disease (BGD), precancerous lesions (PLGC), early GC (EGC), and GC was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC), the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.\n\nRESULTS: Five candidate biomarkers, COL10A1, GKN1, GKN2, LIPF, and REG4, were mined from TCGA, GTEx, and CPTAC databases. In the training cohort, the five proteins were confirmed to be differentially expressed in the serum of control, BGD, EGC, and GC. COL10A1 has the highest AUC of a single protein in control vs. EGC (0.857). GKN2 has the highest AUC of a single protein in BGD vs. EGC (0.822). 5 MP has an AUC of 0.890 in Control vs. EGC, and 0.854 in BGD vs. EGC.

Patients were categorized into an Infection group and a Non-infection group based on the presence of concurrent infections. Clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. Indicators with significant differences were evaluated for collinearity. Non-collinear factors were selected for a logistic regression model to identify infection predictors. Statistically significant variables were used to create a risk prediction nomogram using R software, with internal validation performed.\n\nRESULTS: Statistically Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed between the two groups in terms of C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI, a novel inflammatory biomarker), PNI, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II). No collinearity was detected1 (VIF ≤ 10, tolerance ≥ 0.1). Logistic regression analysis identified CRP, sTREM-1, SIRI, and APACHE II as risk factors for infection (OR > 1, P < 0.05), while PNI was a protective factor (OR < 1, P < 0.05).

We performed a comprehensive multi-omics analysis integrating data from TCGA, GEO, CPTAC, and the Human Protein Atlas to investigate the expression, prognostic value, and immune relevance of EXOSC genes in HNSC. We conducted differential expression analysis, survival analysis (OS, DSS, PFI), ROC curve evaluation, and clinicopathological correlation studies. Genetic alterations were examined using cBioPortal. Gene co-expression and enrichment analyses were used to elucidate potential molecular functions, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed via GeneMANIA. Immune infiltration, immune checkpoint correlations, and RNA modification associations were assessed using ssGSEA, Spearman correlation, and RNA modification databases. Experimental validation was performed by qRT-PCR in HNSC and normal cell lines. All EXOSC family members were significantly upregulated in HNSC tissues and cell lines. ROC analysis demonstrated favorable diagnostic potential, particularly for EXOSC2 (AUC = 0.910). Elevated expression of EXOSC2, EXOSC3, EXOSC8, and EXOSC9 was significantly associated with poor OS, DSS, and PFI. High expression of EXOSC2, EXOSC4, EXOSC5, and EXOSC9 correlated with advanced clinical stage, lymphovascular invasion, and poor therapeutic outcomes. cBioPortal analysis revealed EXOSC4 had the highest genetic alteration frequency (8%), primarily due to amplification. Immune infiltration analysis showed EXOSC gene expression was significantly correlated with various immune cell populations and immune checkpoint molecules, especially EXOSC3, EXOSC9, and EXOSC10. Functional enrichment and PPI network analyses indicated that EXOSC family genes participate in RNA metabolism, exoribonuclease activity, and immune-related pathways. A prognostic risk model based on EXOSC co-expressed genes demonstrated strong predictive performance for patient survival. Our study reveals that EXOSC family genes are significantly dysregulated in HNSC and are associated with tumor progression, prognosis, immune microenvironment modulation, and RNA modification. These findings highlight the potential of EXOSC members as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and suggest their relevance as therapeutic targets in HNSC."

Ninety-six patients with AKI following high-voltage electrical burns, admitted to our hospital from February 2023 to December 2024, were included. They were randomized using a computer-generated random number sequence into two groups: a study group (Xuebijing, n = 48) and a control group (n = 48). This study was conducted in an open-label manner. Neutrophil, inflammatory cell, and ROS levels, as well as kidney function and oxidative stress factors (SOD, MDA), were compared at baseline (1 h before treatment) and 7 days post-treatment. Adverse reactions were recorded. The sample size was determined based on previous similar studies indicating clinically significant differences with comparable group sizes. Prior to treatment, there were no significant differences in BUN, SCr, or urinary protein between groups (P > 0.05). After 7 days, both groups showed significant improvements in BUN, SCr, and urinary protein levels, with the study group showing greater improvement (P < 0.05). Similarly, neutrophils, CRP, IL-18, and IL-6 levels decreased significantly in both groups, with the study group showing greater reductions (P < 0.05). Regarding oxidative stress markers, SOD levels decreased and MDA levels increased post-treatment in both groups. However, compared to the control group, the study group showed a more pronounced decrease in SOD levels and a more pronounced increase in MDA levels (P < 0.05), findings that are contrary to an expected direct antioxidant effect measured by these specific markers. Adverse reactions were mild in both groups, with the control group having a slightly higher rate (8.16% vs. 4.08%), but no significant differences were observed (P = 0.399). Xuebijing can alleviate AKI after high-voltage electrical burns by inhibiting neutrophils and inflammatory cells. While it improves kidney function and reduces inflammation, its effects on SOD and MDA levels suggest a complex interaction with the oxidative stress system that requires further investigation, as the observed changes in these markers (decreased SOD, increased MDA) in the Xuebijing group were more pronounced than in the control group. It shows potential as an effective treatment option for improving kidney function and reducing inflammation, warranting further clinical application.Clinical trial registration This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT07026227 (Date of registration: 18/06/2025)."

Our hypothesis was that weight growth velocity in the test group would be non-inferior to that in the control group.\n\nDESIGN: Double-blind, randomised controlled trial.\n\nSETTING: Nine European neonatal intensive care units.\n\nPATIENTS: HM-fed infants born at <32-week gestational age.\n\nINTERVENTIONS: Fortification of HM with Test or Control HMF for a minimum of 21 days.\n\nPRIMARY OUTCOME: Weight growth velocity between baseline and intervention day 21.\n\nRESULTS: From March 2018 to July 2020, 102 and 103 infants were enrolled in the test and control groups, respectively. Weight growth velocity during the first 21 days in the test group (mean 18.4 g/kg/day) was non-inferior to that of controls (mean 18.5 g/kg/day), with a difference in estimated means of -0.175 g/kg/day (90% CI -1.34 to +0.99 g/kg/day; per-protocol population). No significant differences between groups were observed for gain in length, head circumference or anthropometric Z-scores. Rates of digestive intolerance, stool frequency and consistency were comparable. No significant differences were reported in common neonatal morbidities including necrotising enterocolitis (test: 2.9%, control: 6.9%, mean difference -4.0% (95% CI -11.1% to 2.2%); all subjects treated population).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of the novel HMF containing lipids, higher protein and lower carbohydrate levels supports adequate postnatal growth and appears safe and well tolerated in very preterm infants.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03315221."

    "text": "OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a leading risk factor for global morbidity and mortality, associated with significant healthcare costs that exceed US$260 billion annually in the USA. Weight cycling, the repeated pattern of intentional weight loss followed by unintentional regain, can exacerbate obesity-related health complications. This study aimed to assess the health economic consequences of weight cycling in patients with obesity defined by a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², comparing 'weight cyclers' with 'non-cyclers', and evaluating the impact of a high-protein oral nutritional supplement (HP-ONS) as a maintenance strategy following weight loss via glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs).\n\nDESIGN: Lifetime state transition modelling study with monthly cycles to simulate obesity-associated disease progression.\n\nSETTING: US healthcare system; societal perspective.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: Simulated cohort of adult patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²), stratified by weight cycling status.\n\nINTERVENTIONS: Weight loss via GLP-1RAs with or without HP-ONS for weight maintenance.\n\nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Key outcomes included costs per obesity-related event avoided, life years (LYs) gained and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, calculated from a US societal perspective. Transition probabilities for disease states were derived from meta-analyses and adjusted for weight cycling and other relevant risks. Costs and health utilities were based on published US studies with future costs discounted at 3% per year. Uncertainty was investigated by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.\n\nRESULTS: Non-cyclers experienced 0.090 fewer obesity-associated events, gained 0.602 LYs and achieved 0.518 QALYs compared with cyclers, resulting in total cost savings of approximately US$4592 per patient. In the second scenario, the combination of GLP-1RA treatment and HP-ONS for weight maintenance yielded effective health outcomes with a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$24 276 per QALY gained, well within accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds in the USA, ranging from US$100 000 to US$150 000 per QALY gained.\n\nCONCLUSION: Weight cycling significantly impacts health and economic outcomes for patients with obesity, underscoring the need for effective weight management programmes, including the use of HP-ONS focused on sustained weight maintenance after weight loss to curtail associated risks and costs."

Research has shown that changes in our regular dietary consumption can profoundly influence the composition of the gut microbiota, which possesses the capacity to influence brain functioning through a number of mechanisms, suggesting that dietary modifications may serve as promising therapeutic intervention for managing and potentially mitigating the progression of several neurodegenerative diseases. Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), a neurodegenerative disorder stems from an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within the ATXN3 gene's coding regions. This leads to the production of polyglutamine, contributing to a range of symptoms. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting gut microbiome alterations through dietary interventions for SCA3 has not been extensively investigated. This review is the first to systematically integrate existing evidence on how dietary interventions and gut microbiome dynamics may be leveraged for the therapeutic management of SCA3. Specifically, we explore how dietary components including fermented foods, probiotics, fiber-rich diets, herbal compounds and pharmacological agents, including dietary and natural HDAC inhibitors can influence gut microbiota and modulate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and protein aggregation, which are common hallmarks in neurodegenerative diseases. This paper elucidates the gut microbiota's ability to affect neurological health and its significance in the management of SCA3, hence facilitating future research aimed at treating SCA3 patients by dietary modifications that modify particular gut flora."

Here, we developed a highly sensitive and precise stable isotope-dilution UHPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of five critical intermediates in methionine cycle and methionine salvage pathway: l-methionine (Met), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), l-homocysteine (Hcy), and 5'-methylthioadenosine (5'-MTA). Through optimizing mobile phase additives and implementing an effective dilution strategy, this method minimizes matrix effects. The recovery rates of the five compounds exceeds 71.6 % in cell cytosol and cell medium samples, under a wide concentration range. The validated method presents good precision and linearity, with limits of detection (LODs) ranging from 1.9 fmol/10⁵ cells (SAH) to 555.4 fmol/10⁵ cells (Hcy) in cytosolic fractions, and from 0.7 fmol/10⁵ cells (SAH) to 52.1 fmol/10⁵ cells (Met) in culture media. Application of this validated method to UV-induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells revealed significant dynamic alterations in both intracellular and extracellular release of methionine pathway intermediates during apoptotic progression. The quantification method provides a robust tool for investigating the regulation and functions of methionine metabolism across basic research and clinical applications."

    "text": "Tropomyosin is an important actin cytoskeletal protein underpinning processes such as muscle contraction, cell shape and cell division. Defects in tropomyosin function can lead to diseases, including some myopathies and allergies. In cells, tropomyosin molecules form coiled-coil dimers, which then polymerise end-to-end with other dimers for actin association. Tropomyosin is challenging to tag for in vivo fluorescence microscopy without perturbing its polymerisation interfaces. We recently developed a fluorescent tag comprising a 40-amino acid flexible linker capable of detecting tropomyosin in S. pombe actin cables and the actomyosin ring, and in patch-like structures that were previously unappreciated. We also used this strategy successfully to tag human TPM2.2, a prominent human muscle isoform. Here, we expanded this tool to visualise eight other human tropomyosin isoforms, using mNeonGreen, mCherry, mStayGold(E138D) and mScarlet3-H tags. All showed typical tropomyosin fluorescence, no signs of cytotoxicity and are compatible with super-resolution microscopy. These tools singly or in combination should aid detailed mechanistic investigations of tropomyosin isoforms."

MPS I, II, III, and VII, which are associated with lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulphate (HS), manifest with neurological deterioration and currently lack effective treatments. We report that neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) activity is drastically reduced in brain tissues of patients with neurological MPS and mouse models but not in neurological lysosomal disorders without HS storage. Accumulated HS disrupts the lysosomal multienzyme complex of NEU1 with cathepsin A, β-galactosidase (GLB1), and glucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS), leading to NEU1 deficiency and partial GLB1 and GALNS deficiencies in cortical tissues and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) cortical neurons of patients with neurological MPS. Increased sialylation of N-linked glycans in brains of patients with MPS and mice implicated insufficient processing of sialylated glycans, except for polysialic acid. Correction of NEU1 activity in MPS IIIC mice by lentiviral (LV) gene transfer ameliorated previously identified hallmarks of the disease, including memory impairment, behavioral traits, and reduced levels of excitatory synapse markers VGLUT1 and PSD95. Overexpression of NEU1 also restored levels of VGLUT1/PSD95-positive puncta in cortical iPSC-derived MPS IIIA neurons. Our results demonstrate that HS-induced secondary NEU1 deficiency and aberrant sialylation of brain glycoproteins constitute what we believe is a novel pathological pathway in the neurological MPS spectrum crucially contributing to CNS pathology."

TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) selectively induces apoptosis in tumor cells with minimal impact on normal cells, positioning it as a promising anticancer agent. However, TRAIL resistance remains a major barrier to its clinical effectiveness. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effects of co-treatment with ZER and TRAIL in cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that combined treatment with ZER and TRAIL markedly enhances apoptosis in renal carcinoma cells. ZER treatment induced a decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, which affected TRAIL-mediated cell death. However, Mcl-1 overexpression attenuated combined treatment-mediated cell death. Furthermore, ZER downregulated the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9x expression level, which plays a key role in Mcl-1 stabilization. Also, overexpression of USP9x prevented combined treatment-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that ZER increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis by modulating the USP9x-Mcl-1 axis and ZER may serve as a potential strategy to overcome TRAIL resistance in cancer therapy."

HIV-1-infected macrophages are important mediators of chronic innate immune activation, though the mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that nuclear export and cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA) activates mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein-mediated type I IFN responses in macrophages. In this study, we demonstrate an essential role of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) in sensing HIV-1 icRNA and promoting MAVS-dependent interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) activation in macrophages. Suppression of MDA5 but not retinoic acid-inducible gene I expression nor disruption of the endosomal TLR pathway abrogated HIV-1 icRNA-induced type I IFN responses and IP-10 expression in macrophages. Furthermore, induction of IP-10 in macrophages upon HIV-1 icRNA sensing by MDA5 was dependent on IRF5. Additionally, monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from older (>50 years) individuals exhibited constitutively higher levels of IRF5 expression compared with younger (<35 years) individuals, and HIV-1 icRNA-induced IP-10 expression was significantly enhanced in older macrophages, which was attenuated upon ablation of IRF5 expression, suggesting that IRF5 functions as a major mediator of proinflammatory response downstream of MDA5-dependent HIV-1 icRNA sensing, dysregulation of which might contribute to chronic inflammation in older PWH."

MTGase catalyzes the formation of stable isopeptide bonds at specific glutamine residues and can be harnessed for nanobody labeling via engineered C-terminal c-Myc-tag containing reactive glutamines. In this study, we established a nanobody-based fluorescent sandwich immunoassay for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. An immune VHH library constructed from an immunized alpaca yielded numerous unique nanobodies, ten of which exhibited high binding affinity. These nanobodies were site-specifically conjugated to biotin or Alexa Fluor 488 using MTGase and employed in a directional capture-detection format. The optimized assay, using NB-5F11 for capture and NB-8B5 for detection, demonstrated a broad dynamic range and high sensitivity.

Timely repair of damaged lysosomal membranes is crucial for cell survival. This study aimed to elucidate the role of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent lysosomal membrane repair mechanisms in TDCPP-induced neurotoxicity, focusing on the regulatory roles of apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2) and ALG-2 interacting protein-X (ALIX) in recruiting ESCRT-III complexes. Using in vitro models of TDCPP exposure in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and murine astrocyte cell line C8-D1A, we found that TDCPP exposure led to impaired lysosomal membrane repair via ESCRT-dependent mechanisms, disrupted lysosomal membrane integrity, and induced apoptosis. This impairment was characterized by: decreased expression of ALG-2, ALIX, and the ESCRT-III subunit - charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B); reduced recruitment of CHMP4B mediated by ALG-2/ALIX; increased levels of galectin-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (Cleaved-PARP); and an elevated apoptosis rate. Notably, ALG-2 and ALIX overexpression reinstated CHMP4B accumulation at injury sites, facilitated lysosomal recovery, and mitigated TDCPP-induced lysosomal membrane damage and apoptosis. These findings indicate that TDCPP interferes with ALG-2/ALIX-mediated ESCRT-III recruitment, leading to defective lysosomal membrane repair. Moreover, ALG-2 and ALIX overexpression attenuated TDCPP-induced lysosomal injury, enhancing cell survival. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which TDCPP disrupts lysosomal membrane repair through interference with ALG-2/ALIX-mediated ESCRT-III recruitment, providing the molecular mechanisms of TDCPP-induced neurotoxicity and highlighting potential therapeutic strategies for combating TDCPP toxicity."

The mechanical properties of carriers are particularly crucial for formulation design, storage stability, and practical performance. However, there is currently a lack of reviews on the mechanical properties of natural polymer-based carriers (NPC). This paper delves into the mechanical properties of NPC from five aspects: First, natural polymer wall materials are classified into polysaccharide-based, protein-based, lipid-based, and composite materials, focusing on polysaccharide-dominated systems, and the mechanical properties of NPC constructed from materials of different origins are summarized. Second, various preparation techniques for NPC are introduced, summarizing the mechanical properties of carriers constructed by each method. The paper then examines regulation strategies of the mechanical properties of NPC, including modification techniques, encapsulated substances, morphology, and particle size. Next, methods for characterizing mechanical properties of NPC are introduced. Finally, there is a summary of the progress of NPCs with different mechanical properties in fields, highlighting the challenges faced and proposing future research directions. This review links mechanical optimization to performance, bridging research and applications with eco-friendly NPC strategies."

It is a promising option for the synthesis of biomaterials due to its many therapeutic applications. However, the applicability of Sericin films is limited due to its inherent brittle nature. In this study, we have investigated a novel combination of Sericin (SER) and Xanthan gum (XG) as a plasticizer to create a Sericin-based film with enhanced mechanical and biological performance. This newly developed SER/XG film obtained via physical gelation route, have demonstrated excellent mechanical features in wet state. Therefore, we performed in-situ gelation rheology to correlate the structural features of critical gel (early stage percolation network) with the mechanical properties of the film. Such analysis suggests that the presence of XG suppresses the kinetic arrest of protein in the form of aggregates, leading to significant improvement in the mechanical performance of films. In order to fully comprehend the synergistic SER/XG relationship towards film-forming capabilities, FTIR spectra were also examined. Additionally, these films showed remarkable cell adhesion and proliferation. Finally, the cytocompatibility, hemolysis, and cell-proliferation staining tests carried out to examine the film's in vitro use to highlight the potential of these SER/XG composites as a sustainable material for biomedical applications."

    "text": "AIMS: Our previous studies showed that Leukocyte Cell-Derived Chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), as a ligand for Tie1, modulates vascular endothelial cell function, promoting hepatic fibrosis. These findings prompted an investigation into whether LECT2 effects kidney fibrosis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of LECT2 in kidney fibrosis and its regulation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized Lect2-KO mice, Lect2-2 A-Cre-Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato reporter mice, and EA.hy926 cells overexpressing LECT2 to establish models of kidney fibrosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). The expression characteristics of LECT2 in fibrotic kidneys, its effects on CHOP expression, and the mechanisms by which LECT2 modulates kidney fibrosis were systematically investigated.\n\nKEY FINDINGS: Lect2 expression was upregulated in clinical fibrotic kidney samples and mouse models of fibrotic kidneys. Lect2-KO mice demonstrated reduced fibrosis and less impairment of kidney function in a kidney fibrosis model. In Lect2-KO mice, expression of the ERS marker CHOP was increased, and vascular endothelial cells were activated to express CHOP earlier, reducing kidney function damage. Overexpression of LECT2 decreased apoptosis, promoted cell survival, and upregulated the expression of profibrotic factors through activation of the EGFR/AKT/PI3K pathway. Lect2 deficiency in fibrotic kidneys led to attenuated myofibroblast activation and reduced collagen deposition.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: The absence of LECT2 alleviates kidney fibrosis by inhibiting the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway, activating ERS, promoting partial endothelial cell apoptosis, and reducing the secretion of profibrotic factors. LECT2 emerges as a promising therapeutic target for kidney fibrosis, and its inhibition offers a potential strategy for CKD treatment."

However, assessing the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy drugs remains a challenging task. In recent years, machine learning, especially artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a transformative tool in the field of oncology, capable of integrating multiple clinical and protein biomarkers for more accurate predictions. The study collected clinical data and hematological parameters from 2115 lung cancer patients at Hubei Cancer Hospital. Ten typical machine learning models were selected to predict overall survival and progression-free survival, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and CatBoost. The study found that the CatBoost model performed best in predicting 3-year overall survival and progression-free survival, with AUCs of 0.97 (0.95-0.99) or 0.95 (0.92-0.98). Additionally, the study further analyzed the performance of different machine learning models in patient mortality risk stratification. The CatBoost model excelled in distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk patients, which demonstrated outstanding performance in survival rate prediction at various time points, particularly in predicting survival rates at 1 year (0.54, 0.68), 3 years (0.05, 0.27), and 5 years (0.01, 0.07). The results showed that these models performed well in distinguishing high-risk from low-risk patients, especially the CatBoost model. Therefore, we suggest that these models, particularly the CatBoost model, could serve as practical clinical prediction tools to assist clinicians in developing better and more reasonable treatment plans."

However, the specific mechanisms by which phthalates affect ovarian function remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed 3D spheroids derived from human ovarian stromal cells, which mimic the ovarian tissue. Since remodeling the ovarian extracellular matrix (ECM) is centrally involved in follicle growth, ovulation, and ovarian aging, we decided to study the impact of environmentally relevant phthalate mixtures (PM) on ECM components. Spheroids were generated from both reproductive-aged and menopausal ovarian tissues, then treated with PM for four days. Collagen deposition was assessed using picrosirius red staining, while immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the proliferation and deposition of collagen type VI, elastin, fibrillin-1, and elastin microfibril interfacer 1 (EMILIN-1). Our results revealed that PM exposure significantly increased collagen deposition (p < 0.0001) in spheroids from reproductive-aged ovaries, while reducing collagen VI levels (p < 0.05), potentially compromising the structural and functional integrity of the ovarian ECM. In contrast, spheroids from menopausal ovaries exhibited a decrease in EMILIN-1 (p < 0.05) and fibrillin-1 (p < 0.001), both crucial for maintaining tissue elasticity. These findings underscore the detrimental effects of phthalates on ovarian ECM across different age groups, with a particular emphasis on ECM elastisity. Additionally, this study highlights the utility of 3D spheroids as a reliable in vitro model for mechanistic research, drug screening and toxicology testing."

Preadolescents eat more food per body weight and may be more affected by substances in food compared to adults.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Estimate how diet quality and nutrients are associated with concurrently measured PFAS concentrations in Canadian preadolescents.\n\nMETHODS: Using data from 157 participants (7-11 years) in a Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals follow-up study (2018-2021), we analyzed serum concentrations of 9 PFAS, and derived 2019-Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI-2019) scores and nutrient intakes from 24-h diet recalls. We used multivariable linear regression to estimate cross-sectional associations between diet and serum PFAS concentrations.\n\nRESULTS: Saturated fat consumption was associated with higher serum perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) concentrations. The fruits and vegetables score was associated with higher perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA); similar associations appeared with the HEFI-2019 total score. Percentage of energy intake (%E) from protein was associated with lower perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), PFOS, and perfluorohexanesulphonic acid (PFHxS) while %E from fat was associated with higher PFDA and PFOS. Fiber and iron intakes were associated with higher PFHxS. Vitamin D intake was associated with lower PFNA.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We observed some associations between diet and PFAS. Our findings may be partially explained by toxicokinetics and PFAS presence in Canadian food systems. However, our interpretation is hindered by lack of temporality and potential confounding. Additional investigations which integrate food systems information paired with PFAS concentrations from food and biomonitoring are required."

Foxtail millet is recognized as a health food with rich flavonoids. The objective of this work is to isolate and purify flavonoids from foxtail millet, which have the potential to alleviate MetS and to clarify their mechanism.\n\nRESULTS: Our research combined single-factor experiments and a Box-Behnken design to optimize the extraction processes for millet whole-grain flavonoids (MWGFs) followed by the purification using D101 resin. Components were eluted using varied alcohol concentrations. Additionally, the investigation revealed that MWGF30 notably decreased triglyceride (TG) levels, mitigated lipid uptake in Caco-2 cells induced by free fatty acids, and suppressed lipid absorption in HFD mice while modulating TG, high‑ and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels. Further investigation uncovered that MWGF30 achieved this lipid uptake reduction ability by downregulating the CD36 protein level.\n\nCONCLUSION: Collectively, MWGF30 demonstrated a potent ability to regulate blood lipids and curb lipid absorption, enhancing our comprehension of millet's benefits and furnishing a scientifically grounded dietary approach for MetS. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

A substantial amount of soybeans is allocated to the animal feed sector, human consumption, nutraceuticals and other industrial applications. Soybean has superior protein quality and digestibility compared to other legumes. It also contains abundant amounts of isoflavones, phytosterols and minerals that augment its nutritional value as a constituent of the human diet. Many different by-products are produced during the processing of soy. Due to a lack of sustainable food manufacturing practices, a sustainable amount of these by-products is discarded as waste, posing environmental challenges. Developing an effective waste management system for soybean by-products can help address public health concerns and provide a cost-efficient way to repurpose valuable components of soy, such as soy meal, okara and soy whey. Such valorization can mitigate the environmental impact of waste and contribute to malnutrition.

The measurement of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) has introduced new biomarkers for assessing MS disease activity and progression. However, there is a need for additional diagnostic and prognostic tools. In this study, we investigated the predictive abilities of metabolomics, gut microbiota, as well as clinical and lifestyle factors for MS outcome parameters.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the predictive capacity of plasma metabolites, gut microbiota, and clinical/lifestyle factors on MS outcome measures including MS-related fatigue, MS disability, and sNfL and sGFAP concentrations.\n\nMETHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with 54 individuals with MS. Anthropometric, biological, and lifestyle parameters were collected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm with ten-fold cross-validation was used to identify predictors of MS disease outcome parameters based on plasma metabolomics, microbiota sequencing, and clinical and lifestyle measurements obtained from questionnaires and anthropometric measurements.\n\nRESULTS: Circulating metabolites were found to be superior predictors for sNfL and sGFAP concentrations, while clinical and lifestyle data were associated with EDSS scores. Both plasma metabolites and clinical data significantly predicted MS-related fatigue. Combining multiple multi-omics data did not consistently improve predictive performance.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the value of plasma metabolites as predictors of sNfL, sGFAP, and fatigue in MS.

    "text": "BACKGROUND Warts are common cutaneous viral infections primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). They occur in all age groups, with immunocompromised individuals being particularly susceptible. Patients with compromised immune systems, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), organ transplant recipients, and individuals on immunosuppressive therapies, are at a higher risk of developing warts. These patients are also more likely to have severe and persistent warts, often necessitating multiple treatment approaches. Conventional therapies such as cryotherapy, laser ablation, and topical treatments often yield suboptimal results in this population due to their compromised immune response. Although intralesional immunotherapy, such as purified protein derivative (PPD), has been shown to stimulate a systemic immune response and facilitate wart clearance, its use in immunosuppressed individuals remains under-reported and under-utilized in clinical practice. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 70-year-old woman with a history of immunosuppression who presented with multiple recalcitrant warts on her left hand. Due to the persistence of lesions despite previous treatments, she received PPD injection sessions in a single lesion. Remarkably, all of her warts regressed completely within 6 weeks, with no recurrence observed during follow-up. No adverse effects were reported, highlighting the safety of this approach. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the potential of PPD immunotherapy as an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment modality for warts in immunocompromised patients. Given its immunostimulatory properties and ability to induce systemic clearance, PPD should be considered a valuable alternative for managing refractory warts in this high-risk population. Further studies are warranted to establish standardized protocols and optimize its clinical application."

    "text": "Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential. However, the lack of efficient and scalable methods for sEV separation remains a critical barrier to their large-scale production as therapeutic agents. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) has emerged as a promising technique for large-scale sEV separation, but the absence of comprehensive and systematic studies makes it challenging to determine optimal TFF parameters for sEV isolation. In this study, we investigated the effects of key TFF parameters, including shear stress, molecular weight cutoff (MWCO), transmembrane pressure (TMP), and washing-filtration cycles, on sEVs separation and impurity removal. We evaluated particle concentration, size distribution, morphology, chemical properties, fluorescence, and protein content to assess the impact of these parameters. The results revealed that excessive shear stress (>9.05 Pa) during TFF led to protein aggregation and sEV damage. Using a filter membrane with an MWCO of 750 kDa and maintaining TMP between 3 and 5 psi prevented sEV leakage and achieved moderately high filtration efficiency. Based on these findings, optimal TFF parameters were identified. sEVs isolated using optimized TFF conditions (TFF-sEVs) were then compared with sEVs isolated via ultracentrifugation (UC-sEVs). TFF-sEVs exhibited comparable physical properties and purity to UC-sEVs but demonstrated superior proliferation-promoting activity and a 3-fold higher recovery rate. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that TFF-sEVs were enriched with extracellular vesicle membrane proteins and corona proteins, contributing to their enhanced bioactivity. In summary, optimizing TFF parameters enables efficient purification of sEVs, balancing purity, recovery, and bioactivity, paving the way for scalable production of sEVs and accelerating the clinical translation of sEV-based therapeutics."

    "text": "For the toxicokinetic evaluation of a lipid conjugate of the cell-penetrating peptide cyclic nonaarginine, we aimed to develop a highly sensitive plasma quantification. Due to the amphiphilic properties and high number of basic amino acids, plasma bioanalysis with LC-MS/MS instruments is difficult. Challenges in particular include chromatographic characteristics, minimal extraction recovery, and resistance against collision-induced dissociation. We developed a quantification of a nonextractable CPP-lipid conjugate by eliminating the lipid part by phospholipase D digestion, enabling the efficient extraction of a surrogate peptide for analysis. Chromatographic separation was feasible only with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-based mobile phases. Ion suppression caused by TFA was reversed by postcolumn addition of aqueous ammonia. Efficient extraction of the surrogate peptide fragment was achieved by protein precipitation with TFA. This enabled the highly sensitive quantification of the CPP-lipid conjugate in plasma in the low picomolar range (lower limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL; 34 pM). The assay was validated according to the pertinent recommendations of the ICH M10 guideline on bioanalytical method validation and applied to the determination of the intravenous pharmacokinetics of the CPP-lipid conjugate in Beagle dogs. Applicability was further demonstrated by validation of the assay for human plasma. The established strategy can be used as a general approach to the bioanalysis of amphiphilic lipid conjugates by using lipase digestion to generate extractable surrogate fragments. Additionally, TFA-based UPLC-MS/MS analysis with desolvation of TFA adducts by postcolumn addition of ammonia is feasible for the regulated, highly sensitive quantification of arginine-rich peptides."

These metallogels are found to show excellent auto-healing and load-bearing aptitudes. Microstructural investigations are executed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) to expose metal-source and solvent-directed morphological patterns for these three different metallogels. The stability of synthesized metallogels of Co(II) and Zn(II) metal salts with versatile polar aprotic solvent media is experimentally investigated through stimuli-responsiveness studies. The influences of diverse chemical stimuli such as acid and base on different metallogels are thoroughly captured through FESEM morphological investigations. The involvement of versatile noncovalent interactions to build these soft metallogel networks is opened via analyzing FT-IR and ESI-mass studies. The anticancer potential of these synthesized metallogels is inspected against a cancer cell line of HepG2. All of the metallogels effectively exhibited remarkable anticancer properties. Among these three metallogels, the Zn-PTA-DMF offered a prominent reduction of the cancer cell line of HepG2 and also has an efficiency to inhibit proliferation and expedite the mechanism of cellular death. By enhancing the cytotoxic effect, the Zn-PTA-DMF metallogel offered growth inhibition of cell lines."

The purpose of this dose-ranging phase 1 study (CIMON) was to evaluate the first-in-man use of MaaT033, a pooled, allogeneic, lyophilized, and standardized fecal microbiotherapeutic product, formulated as a delayed-release capsule for oral administration. Primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of MaaT033 in 21 patients with AML having undergone IC and antibiotics. Secondary objectives were to assess MaaT033 safety, its efficacy in restoring the patients' gut microbiome using shotgun sequencing to evaluate the recommended dose regimen, and patient compliance. MaaT033 was shown to be safe and effective for gut microbiota restoration in patients with AML receiving IC and antibiotics, with an excellent gut microbiota reconstruction based on diversity indices at the species level and restoration of microbial communities close to the composition of the drug product. The maximum tolerable dose of MaaT033 was not determined because the interim results suggested adequate efficacy as measured by engraftment at lower doses (3 capsules per day). Moreover, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6) decrease with treatment, whereas short-chain fatty acids increase over time. A randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial, in recipients of alloHCT patients is ongoing. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT04150393."

First, the YOLOX was employed for automated 3D lung extraction to extract radiomics features. Second, two feature selection algorithms were applied to select critical features from both CT radiomics and occupational health data. Third, three distinct feature sets were constructed for model training: CT radiomics features, occupational health data, and their multimodal integration. Finally, five machine learning models were implemented to predict the preclinical stage of CWP. The model's performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values were calculated to determine the prediction role of each feature in the model with the highest predictive performance.\n\nRESULTS: The YOLOX-based lung extraction demonstrated robust performance, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.98. 8 CT radiomic features and 4 occupational health surveillance data were selected for the multimodal model.

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma, presenting significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Despite recent advancements in targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors, drug resistance remains a major obstacle in metastatic ccRCC. As a member of the AAA + ATPase superfamily, TRIP13 has been implicated in tumorigenesis across various cancers. however, its specific role and underlying mechanisms in ccRCC are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to explore the functional role and mechanisms of TRIP13 in ccRCC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.\n\nMETHODS: Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to assess the expression, prognostic significance, clinical relevance, and oncogenic role of TRIP13 in ccRCC patients. In vitro, cell viability, cycle progression, apoptosis, and migration/invasion were evaluated using CCK-8, colony formation, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell assays. In vivo tumorigenic potential was assessed through a nude mouse xenograft model. Protein expression and interactions were analyzed by western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and RT-qPCR.\n\nRESULTS: We demonstrated that TRIP13 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC tissues and correlates with poor prognosis, advanced tumor grade, and metastasis. Additionally, we uncovered an interdependent relationship between TRIP13 expression, immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, and drug resistance. Functional assays revealed that TRIP13 promotes ccRCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, TRIP13 activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and enhances cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by upregulating NUSAP1.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TRIP13 is upregulated in ccRCC and may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for patient survival and treatment response. Additionally, TRIP13 enhances ccRCC cell proliferation, invasion, and EMT via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, while its expression is closely linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint regulation, offering new insights for immunotherapeutic approaches in ccRCC."

Mitochondrial defects precede muscle mass and functional losses in models of cancer cachexia (CC). We hypothesized targeting Opa1-a key regulator of mitochondrial fusion-can attenuate LLC-induced CC outcomes.\n\nMETHODS: We utilized 1) in vivo transgenic Opa1 overexpression (OPA1 TG) in LLC-induced CC in vivo, and 2) BPG15 administration to induce Opa1 in vitro and in vivo.\n\nRESULTS: OPA1 TG attenuated plantaris, gastrocnemius, and EDL loss with LLC in males and alleviated gastrocnemius loss in females. OPA1 TG had greater mitochondrial respiration in plantaris and white gastrocnemius, and lowered pMitoTimer Red Puncta (-63%), a proxy for mitophagy in males. OPA1 TG protected muscle contractility at physiological stimulation frequencies by up to 60% in female LLC mice. OPA1 TG enhanced the ratio of OPA1/DRP1 protein content-a proxy for fusion and fission balance-in males and females. In vitro, BGP-15 attenuated LLC conditioned media-induced myotube atrophy by ~ 9% concomitant with suppression of the transcriptional factor FoxO3, autophagy markers, and inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, BGP-15 improved contractility at lower frequencies (10-60 Hz), with LLC-BGP-15 showing up to 20% greater torque than LLC-control. BGP-15 treated LLC animals had 71% fewer pMitoTimer red puncta, suggesting attenuated mitophagy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Promoting mitochondrial fusion via OPA1 induction improved cachectic outcomes in mice. Targeting OPA1providing provides a promising therapeutic approach for CC treatment."

Patients with untreated achalasia suffer from dysphagia and regurgitation and, consequently, weight loss as they require dietary modifications related to impaired esophageal emptying. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is considered the mainstay of therapy, leading to symptom relief, restoration of normal eating patterns and weight gain.\n\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to describe the metabolic state of an organism in time of insufficient nutrition and the relation among levels of systemic metabolites and changes in body's composition in condition of normalised food intake.\n\nMETHODS: We monitored body composition, as well as biochemical parameters in 43 patients with achalasia before and 3 months after POEM intervention. We also determined the levels of circulating metabolites via NMR spectroscopy which were, besides comparison to controls, used to describe metabolic turnover before and after treatment.\n\nRESULTS: After POEM, all patients except four individuals gained weight (p-value 3.07e-11), and accordingly, the BMI value changed (p-value 2.85e-9). Paired test revealed an increase in absolute fat (p-value 0.00176) and muscle mass (p-value 0.00201). Metabolic analysis in patients with untreated achalasia showed a ketotic-like state with inadequate glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, which partially normalized three months after POEM. Post-POEM muscle mass gain was positively (p < 0.05-0.0005) and increase in absolute fat mass was negatively correlated (p-value < 0.05-0.0005) with the levels of circulating amino acids before the intervention.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our observations provide complex insight into the metabolic shifts after successful treatment of achalasia that is directly related to the changes in the body composition. The metabolic alterations were not detectable through standard biochemical tests suggesting that conventional diagnostics may not fully reflect the metabolic condition of patients with achalasia."

One such target is Fibronectin Extra Domain-B (Fn-EDB), an oncofetal splice variant of a major extracellular matrix protein (Fn), which is upregulated in many solid tumors as part of the angiogenic response. In this study, we conducted cell-free biopanning on recombinant Fn-EDB to identify a short peptide designated as PL2 (amino acid sequence: TSKQNSR), which specifically interacts with Fn-EDB. Notably, the C-terminal arginine of PL2 enables its interaction with neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a receptor known to facilitate cell and tissue penetration. When administered systemically, PL2-displaying recombinant bacteriophages and iron oxide nanoworms (NWs) functionalized with PL2 peptide exhibited homing to glioblastoma and prostate tumor xenografts, followed by their extravasation and penetration into tumor parenchyma. This preclinical study demonstrates that PL2-functionalized NWs penetrate ex vivo explants of clinical ovarian carcinoma, highlighting their proof-of-concept potential as tumor-homing and tissue-penetrating agents for precision oncology, pending further efficacy and safety validation. These findings underscore the potential of the PL2 peptide as a promising agent for anticancer drug delivery and molecular imaging applications."

Currently, there is no specific treatment for SIC beyond supportive care. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has shown potential in regulating inflammation and coagulation pathways. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of taVNS in improving coagulation dysfunction in patients with SIC, with the primary outcome being the proportion of patients achieving a ≥2-point improvement in SIC score by day 7.\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre, randomised, sham-controlled, single-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of taVNS in patients with SIC. This study will enrol 184 adult patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for SIC. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either active taVNS or sham stimulation for 7 consecutive days. The intervention will be applied twice daily for 7 consecutive days using standardised stimulation parameters (25 Hz, 3 mA, 60 min/session). The primary outcome is the proportion of patients achieving an improvement of ≥2 points in SIC score from baseline to day 7. Secondary outcomes include platelet count, international normalised ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, angiopoietin-2, systemic immune-inflammation index, lactic acid, duration of antibiotic therapy, length of hospital stay and 28-day all-cause mortality.

Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were used to differentiate patients with ANCA-GN from HCs via ROC analysis. The prediction performance of the potential biomarkers was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). Detection results for the immune response-related proteins showed 54 DEPs between ANCA-GN patients and HCs. KEGG enrichment analysis of these 54 DEPs revealed that were mainly enriched in chemokine signaling pathway, IL17 signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Among the top 14 core proteins in the protein-protein interaction network, 8 were closely related to renal function, namely IL1A, IFNG, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IL4, IL5, and CCL11.

    "text": "Kidney stones are one of the most common and debilitating urological disorders, putting substantial financial burden on healthcare services. Most common kidney stones are comprised of calcium oxalate often mixed with some calcium phosphate. Pathogenesis involves crystallization and retention of crystals within the kidneys, which is achieved either through the formation of crystalline plugs in the terminal collecting ducts blocking their openings into the renal pelvis, or formation of plaques of calcium phosphate on the renal papillary surface. The plugs are termed Randall's plugs and the plaques Randall's plaques. Several cell culture and animal model studies have been carried out to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of calcium oxalate kidney stones to develop better treatments for the disease. Results of such studies have shown that exposure to oxalate and calcium oxalate/phosphate crystal leads to the production of reactive oxygen species and localized injury and inflammation. In addition, there are signs of autophagy and osteogenic changes in exposed cells. Modes of injury and cell death include apoptosis, ferroptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. Our review of relevant literature indicates that necrotic and necroptotic changes may be involved in the formation of Randall's plugs and associated kidney stones. Randall's plaque formation is most likely an outcome of the oxidant stress induced osteogenic changes in the tubular epithelium of the limbs of the loops of Henle and papillary collecting ducts and production of MMPs. Calcium phosphate deposition starts in the basement membrane, continues through the interstitium, mineralizing the collagen and membrane bound vesicles, until it reaches the papillary surface. The loss of urothelium most likely through the activation of MMPs exposes the plaque to the pelvic urine. Both plugs and plaque act as the platform for further deposition of crystals eventually developing into the stones."

Based on participant feedback, all 14 diary items were clear and generally easy to answer using the response scales, and all were interpreted as intended. The 3 global items received similar feedback, although a few participants noted that there were challenges in interpreting the items, describing questions as \"vague\" and \"confusing\", or that responses were too limited; one-third reported having difficulty calculating overall symptom experience for multiple symptoms. Participants reported that the electronic application for the diary and global items was easy to use and enabled the items to be easily completed. Exit interview results support the content validity of the COVID-19 symptom diary and global impression items, with the 14 symptoms included in the diary reflecting the most commonly experienced COVID-19 symptoms.

In particular, some mutations in oncoproteins like MEK1, MEK2, PI3Kα, PTEN, SHAP2, and RAS are linked various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). While numerous tools exist for predicting the pathogenicity of missense mutations, linking these mutations to certain phenotypes remains a major challenge, particularly in the context of personalized medicine. To fill this gap, we developed protPheMut (Protein Phenotypic Mutations Analyzer, http://netprotlab.com/protPheMut), leveraging interpretable machine learning approaches and enhancing model transparency through SHAP explanations, to integrate diverse biophysical and network dynamics-based signatures for predicting whether mutations in the same protein promote cancer or NDDs. Overall, proPheMut achieved an AUCROC of 0.9118 in cross-validation and 0.8925 on an independent test set for discriminating cancer- versus NDDs-related mutations. We further illustrate its utility in phenotype (cancer/NDDs) prediction by mutation analyses of two protein cases, PI3Kα and PTEN. Compared to seven other predictive tools, protPheMut demonstrated exceptional accuracy in forecasting phenotypic effects, achieving an AUROC of 0.8501 for PI3Kα mutations related to cancer and Cowden syndrome. For multi-phenotype prediction of PTEN mutations related to cancer, PHTS, and HCPS, protPheMut achieved an AUROC of 0.9349 through micro averaging. Using SHAP model explanations, protPheMut highlights the strength of network and dynamic features in deeper uncovering of the effects of pathogenic mutations, thus classifying different disease phenotypes."

    "text": "Tumor cells rely on the high expression of transporter proteins to meet their nutrient demands, with alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2) being a key player in glutamine (Gln) uptake. Glutamine, a conditionally essential amino acid abundant in protein-rich foods, such as meat, dairy, and legumes, serves as a critical nitrogen and carbon source for cellular biosynthesis. ASCT2-mediated Gln transport not only fuels cancer progression but also plays a role in nutrient absorption in healthy tissues, particularly the gut, where dietary amino acids are assimilated. Despite its dual significance in physiology and pathology, the molecular mechanisms of Gln transport by ASCT2 remain poorly understood, hindering the development of targeted therapies and dietary interventions. In this study, microsecond classical and Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (CMD/GaMD) were conducted to investigate the dynamic mechanism of glutamine transportation by ASCT2. A Markov State Model (MSM) was built based on the enhanced sampling trajectories to search for the communication pathways and critical transition states during the allosteric movement of helical hairpin 2 (HP2), a structural gatekeeper of transport. Additionally, the C467R mutation was found to disrupt HP2 dynamics, impair Gln binding, and hinder Gln transport. Intriguingly, substrate-bound ASCT2 exhibited prolonged HP2 opening compared to its unloaded state, suggesting that food-derived Gln may stabilize transporter conformations. The important transition states of the transporter opening process were also identified from the MSM. The key pathway from the \"close\" to \"open\" state is S2 → S15 → S10 → S6 → S5 → S7 → S19, with a maximum probability of 16.76%. These findings not only advance ASCT2-targeted drug discovery but also offer a framework for designing functional foods or nutraceuticals that modulate amino acid bioavailability, potentially leveraging natural compounds to fine-tune ASCT2 activity for cancer prevention or metabolic health optimization."

This review aims to provide a thorough synthesis of recent advancements in the investigation of cognitive aging in the brain, highlighting multidimensional assessment techniques, neurobiological foundations, molecular regulatory pathways, systemic changes, environmental-gene interactions, and intervention strategies. Evidence suggests that cognitive aging is marked not only by widespread neuronal loss but also by subtle modifications within neural networks, protein homeostasis, mitochondrial functionality, and epigenetic regulation. The integration of various technological methodologies has shed light on the continuum that exists between cognitive aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Concurrently, multidimensional intervention strategies are being proposed; however, current research frameworks face challenges due to limitations in biomarker systems, indicating a need for a paradigm shift. Future investigations should leverage emerging technologies to develop more precise regulatory frameworks and personalized intervention strategies aimed at addressing the global challenges associated with aging, thereby enhancing the prevention and treatment of related pathologies."

Intima-media thickness (IMT), presence, and number of ASP in the carotid arteries were studied using duplex ultrasound imaging. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI) were assessed via applanation tonometry method. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) on multislice computed tomography was scored using the Agatston calcium index (ACI). BMD was measured using by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nRESULTS: Women with osteoporosis had higher IMT values (p = 0.045), more ASP (p < 0.001), and higher ACI (p < 0.001) than those with normal BMD values. In a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for age, duration of postmenopause, BMI, and levels of CTX and ALP in blood serum, we confirmed that ACI makes an independent contribution to the reduction in BMD of all measured parts of the skeleton, while IMT and the presence of ASP contribute to the reduction in BMD of femoral neck.\n\nCONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrated an association between vascular calcification, the presence of ASP in the carotid arteries and low bone mass in women without clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, which is of clinical significance and important for the prevention of both osteoporotic fractures and cardiovascular incidents."

However, their clinical applications are often constrained by challenges such as low stability, short circulation half-life, immunogenic responses, and high manufacturing expenses. The rapid development of biodegradable and biocompatible polypeptide materials provides innovative strategies to address these limitations. In particular, polypeptide-protein conjugation, the covalent linkage of a polypeptide chain to therapeutic proteins, has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing specific delivery of therapeutic proteins. Leveraging the unique properties of polypeptides, these conjugates significantly improve the stability, solubility, and bioavailability of therapeutic proteins, thereby enhancing their therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in this field, discussing the current obstacles faced by therapeutic proteins in clinical applications, fundamental design principles, and methodologies for constructing well-defined polypeptide-protein conjugates. Key advancements discussed include innovations in polypeptide synthesis, protein modification, bioorthogonal reactions for precise conjugation, techniques for conjugate purification and characterization. The review further summarizes recent progresses of various polypeptide-protein conjugates for therapeutic protein delivery. Current obstacles and future research directions are also highlighted, underscoring the potential of polypeptide-protein conjugation to propel further advancement in therapeutic protein delivery."

This study presents NaC4A-PROTACs, a hypoxia-responsive host-guest drug delivery system where azo-modified calixarene derivative (Naph-SAC4A) acts as the host molecule, encapsulating PROTAC molecules as the guest. The PROTAC molecules are incorporated into the host cavity of Naph-SAC4A through reversible non-covalent interactions, forming well-defined supramolecular complexes, which, to our knowledge, represent the first supramolecular host-guest PROTAC delivery system. These complexes remain stable under normoxic physiological conditions. But in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, Naph-SAC4A undergo enzyme-catalyzed azo bond cleavage, significantly reducing the host-guest binding affinity of the supramolecular complex. Subsequently, PROTAC molecules are efficiently released from the calixarene cavity to degrade bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) proteins. We demonstrate the efficacy of NaC4A-PROTACs for hypoxia-targeted therapy both in vitro and in vivo, showing significant enhancement of PROTACs bioavailability, improved tumor-specific delivery, and potent anti-tumor effects.

To address this limitation, we have developed a nanocomplex comprised of a mast cell (MC) agonist and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand to adjuvant a broadly acting influenza antigen. The newly reported MC agonist was identified by screening mastoparan-7 analogs for MC degranulation activity, which led to a more active peptide analog, MP12W. Positively charged MP12W spontaneously forms nanoparticulate complexes (NPs) with CpG 1826 that were then used to intranasally vaccinate mice with a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) hemagglutinin (HA) protein. The NPs were further optimized by substituting CpG 1826 with CpG 55.2, a TLR-9 agonist identified by machine learning to be more active in humans. MP12W-CpG 1826 NPs showed an increased pro-inflammatory response and decreased cytotoxicity in vitro compared to M7 complexes, translating into a safer profile in a model of increased hypersensitivity, collaborative cross mice 027 (CC027). Intranasal vaccination with this complex and broadly reactive HA resulted in higher mucosal antibody concentration and increased cytokine production with antigen recall. These responses were enhanced with MP12W-CpG 55.2 NP vaccination. MP12W-CpG NPs provided similar protection in an influenza challenge model.

Patients were categorized into a VTE group (55 cases) and a non-VTE group (265 cases) based on the occurrence of VTE within six months postoperatively. An additional 60 elderly lung cancer patients who underwent surgery between June and November 2024 were selected for external validation. General clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups, and risk factors for postoperative VTE were analyzed to construct and validate the predictive model.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of postoperative VTE was 17.19% (55/320). Compared with the non-VTE group, the VTE group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, extremely high-risk Caprini scores, surgical duration ≥ 120 min, open surgery, clinical stage III-IV disease, preoperative chemotherapy, positive D-dimer (D-D) >3.64 mg/L, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified extremely high-risk Caprini scores, surgical duration ≥ 120 min, open surgery, clinical stage III-IV disease, preoperative chemotherapy, positive D-D>3.64 mg/L, and elevated CRP levels as independent risk factors for postoperative VTE (P < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the model had excellent discrimination, accuracy, and predictive performance.\n\nCONCLUSION: The incidence of postoperative VTE in elderly lung cancer patients is relatively high. Key risk factors include an extremely high-risk Caprini score, surgical duration ≥ 120 min, open surgery, clinical stage III-IV disease, preoperative chemotherapy, positive D-D>3.64 mg/L, and elevated CRP levels.

    "text": "TMEM106B is a lysosome/late endosome protein that is a potent genetic modifier of multiple neurodegenerative diseases as well as general aging. Recently, TMEM106B was shown to form insoluble aggregates in postmortem human brain tissue, drawing attention to TMEM106B pathology and the potential role of TMEM106B aggregation in disease. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TMEM106B has been studied in vivo using animal models of neurodegeneration, but these studies rely on overexpression or knockdown approaches. To date, endogenous TMEM106B pathology and its relationship to known canonical pathology in animal models has not been reported. Here, we analyze histological patterns of the endogenous TMEM106B protein in murine models of C9ORF72-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), SOD1-related ALS, and tauopathy using an extensively validated TMEM106B antibody. We found profound correlations between the endogenous TMEM106B protein with known TDP-43 and tau pathology in murine models of C9-ALS/FTD and tauopathy, respectively. By using an antibody previously shown to recognize the pathologic TMEM106B C-terminal fragments, we then performed a similar analysis on postmortem brain tissues from patients with C9-ALS/FTD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and AD with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (AD/LATE). Convergent evidence from both murine models and human patients links TMEM106B to TDP-43 nuclear clearance at the cellular level in C9-ALS. By characterizing endogenous TMEM106B in mice and human postmortem tissue, our work reveals essential considerations that must be taken when analyzing data from in vivo mouse studies and elucidates new insights supporting the involvement of TMEM106B in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Esketamine has been used in the prevention of postoperative neurocognitive disorders in trauma surgery, gastrointestinal surgery and other fields due to its significant anti-inflammatory effect. However, its effect on postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients with fragile brain function after lung cancer remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the effect of low-dose esketamine on POD in older patients with fragile brain function following lung cancer surgery during the perioperative period.\n\nMETHODS: One hundred and eight older patients undergoing thoracoscopic radical lung cancer surgery were randomly assigned to the control group or the esketamine group. All patients received standardized anesthesia without pre-anesthesia medication. Esketamine group received esketamine 0.25 mg/kg during anesthesia induction and esketamine 0.1 mg/kg/h during anesthesia maintenance for 30 min. Control group received an equal volume of normal saline during both induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used to evaluate the incidence(%) of POD at 24 h and 72 h post-surgery. Serum concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and calcium-binding protein β(S100β)(mean ± SD) were measured intravenously before and one day after surgery to assess inflammation. Additionally, intraoperative dosages of propofol, sufentanil, and remifentani(mean ± SD)were recorded, along with postoperative extubation time, SpO\n\nRESULTS: Compared with the control group, the incidence of POD was significantly lower in the esketamine group at 24 h post-operation (3.8% vs. 15.1%, P = 0.046),but no difference at 72 h post-operation (0% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.126). No significant difference in serum concentration of IL-6 and S100β was observed between the two groups on the day before surgery (P > 0.05). However, one day post-operation serum concentration of IL-6 and S100β in the esketamine group were significantly lower than those in the control group (5.14 ± 1.70 vs. 6.03 ± 2.13, P = 0.019;380.08 ± 204.01 vs. 479.32 ± 213.07, P = 0.016). The consumption of sufentanil in the esketamine group was lower than those in the control group (28.06 ± 3.76 vs. 29.85 ± 4.21, P = 0.023). Extubation time, the rate of remedial analgesia, and recovery room stay duration were shorter in the esketamine group compared to the control group(27.08 ± 8.46 vs. 30.4.±7.72, P = 0.035; 5.7% vs. 18.9%, P = 0.038; 58.96 ± 16.98 vs. 65.83 ± 15.31, P = 0.031).

Although BPA shows clinical promise in liver cancer, there is relatively little basic research on its effect on hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we systematically evaluated the uptake, safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy of BPA. Boron uptake in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hepa1-6, HepG2) was quantified by ICP-AES, revealing concentration- and time-dependent accumulation (plateau at 6 h), while CCK-8 assays indicated significant cytotoxicity at 24 h. Pharmacokinetic studies in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats showed rapid boron distribution (peak at 25 ± 5.8 min) with a blood clearance half-life of 74.71 ± 52.22 min. In tumor-bearing mouse models, BPA achieved tumor-specific targeting, with tumor-to-normal tissue (T/N) and tumor-to-blood (T/B) ratios exceeding 2 and 4, respectively, at 2 h post-injection, followed by rapid systemic clearance. Cell viability significantly decreased after BPA-BNCT irradiation, and the tumor growth inhibition rate in mice reached 77%. BPA did not produce tissue damage in vivo, and there were no abnormalities in blood counts or liver or kidney function in vivo after irradiation. These findings suggest that BPA can be selectively enriched in hepatocellular tumors with good pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy, supporting its clinical application in BNCT of hepatocellular carcinoma."

To address this gap, we utilized a multi-omics approach to investigate how bariatric surgery influences Emirati individuals with T2D and prediabetes, focusing on the early detection of CVD markers. We longitudinally profiled 19 patients over a 9-month period, collecting omics data, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), protein immunoassays, untargeted metabolomics, and 16S rRNA sequencing to determine gut microbiome composition. Through this study, we showed that bariatric surgery reduced CVD risk and inflammatory biomarkers while inducing changes in the gut microbiome and metabolomic profiles. We identified four inflammatory biomarkers (FGF-basic, TNFSF13, IL-8, and IL-1Ra) that were significantly altered following surgery (p < 0.05). Additionally, we identified 98 metabolites that showed significant changes after surgery that are involved in folate biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid, and retinol metabolism. Eighteen microbial genera were found to differentiate between the pre- and post-surgery states. Our analysis revealed four microbial genera (Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Gemella, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003) associated with two T2D SNPs (rs11830243 and rs6978118) and three CVD SNPs (rs9490306, 62207434, and rs34606058). These genera formed the network's central hub, connecting host genetic variants, metabolic pathways, and clinical data, highlighting their role in host-microbiome interactions. The study quantifies the impact of phenotypic factors on CVD progression among UAE nationals, contributing to a deeper understanding of cardiometabolic health within this population."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Start loss variants are a class of genetic variants that affect the bases of the start codon, disrupting the normal translation initiation process and leading to protein deletions or the production of different proteins. Accurate assessment of the pathogenicity of these variants is crucial for deciphering disease mechanisms and integrating genomics into clinical practice. However, among the tens of thousands of start loss variants in the human genome, only about 1% have been classified as pathogenic or benign. Computational methods that rely solely on small amounts of labeled data often lack sufficient generalization capabilities, restricting their effectiveness in predicting the impact of start loss variants.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we introduce StartCLR, a novel prediction method specifically designed for identifying pathogenic start loss variants. StartCLR captures variant context information from different dimensions by integrating embedding features from diverse DNA language models. Moreover, it employs self-supervised pre-training combined with supervised fine-tuning, enabling the effective utilization of both a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results show that StartCLR exhibits strong generalization and superior prediction performance across different test sets. Notably, when trained exclusively on high-confidence labeled data, StartCLR retains or even improves the prediction accuracy despite the reduced amount of labeled data.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of integrating self-supervised contrastive learning with unlabeled data to mitigate the challenge posed by the scarcity of labeled start loss variants."

However, it can cause immune-related adverse events, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Such adverse events can interrupt treatment, affecting patient outcomes. Early prediction of AKI is essential for improved prognosis and personalized therapeutic strategies. Previous research has been constrained by significant limitations, underscoring the necessity for AKI risk prediction models for patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model for early AKI prediction in patients undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy using a retrospective cohort design.\n\nMETHODS: This study collected data from patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors at Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital between January 2018 and January 2024. Nine ML models were evaluated. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to rank feature importance and interpret the final model. Additionally, a web-based calculator based on the model was developed.\n\nRESULTS: Among the nine ML models evaluated, the Grandient Boosting Machine (GBM) model achieved the best predictive performance. In the validation set, the GBM model achieved an AUC of 0.850 (95%CI: 0.830-0.870). In the test set, the AUC was 0.795(95% CI: 0.747-0.844), demonstrating accurate AKI risk prediction. Calibration curves demonstrated a strong concordance between predicted and observed risk probabilities. An interpretable final GBM model with 13 features was developed after feature reduction based on feature importance ranking. A web-based calculator accessible at https://predicatingaki.shinyapps.io/PDmodel/ has been developed to assist clinicians in AKI risk assessment.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study developed and validated an interpretable ML model using a large dataset to predict AKI risk in patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. This model can assist clinicians in the early identification of high-risk patients, facilitating personalized treatment plans.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (Approval No. KT2024116) in 3 Jan. 2025.

High-load resistance training of the upper body is one way to achieve mechanical loading of the lumbar spine and the hip bones. In addition, maintaining good nutritional status with key nutrients for bone remodeling, that is, vitamin D and calcium, is important for bone accrual.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effect of 24 weeks of high-load resistance training combined with nutritional optimization on lumbar spine BMD. Secondary objectives are to investigate the effects of the intervention on (1) bone and physical health parameters, such as bone turnover blood markers, nutritional status, body composition, and maximal muscular strength, as well as (2) exercise motivation and mental health.\n\nMETHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to include 60 wheelchair users with nonprogressive impairments. Participants were randomly allocated to 24 weeks of either (1) high-load resistance training and nutrition optimization or (2) nutrition optimization only, stratified by sex and sport activity status. The training program consisted of 3 weekly sessions comprising 6 exercises periodized in low-, moderate-, and high-load phases. The nutritional optimization aimed to ensure sufficient intake of protein, vitamin D, and calcium. BMD and body composition; maximal muscular strength; and nutritional, physical, and mental health status were assessed at baseline, midpoint, and postintervention visits. Furthermore, follow-up assessments of a subgroup were conducted at 6 to 18 months after the intervention. This protocol was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics South-East, Norway.\n\nRESULTS: Recruitment occurred between November 2022 and 2023. A total of 68 wheelchair users were screened for eligibility, of whom 45 (66%) were enrolled and allocated to one of the study groups (n=24, 53% training group; n=21, 47% control group).

Our laboratory has engineered an ester-linked L-serine conjugate to butyrate (SerBut) to mask its taste and odor and to coopt amino acid transporters in the gut to increase its systemic bioavailability, as determined by tissue measurements of free butyrate, produced by hydrolysis of SerBut. In an apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE)-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis, SerBut reduced systemic LDL-C, proinflammatory cytokines, and circulating neutrophils. SerBut enhanced inhibition of plaque progression and reduced monocyte accumulation in the aorta compared with sodium butyrate. SerBut suppressed liver injury biomarkers alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase and suppressed steatosis in the liver. SerBut overcomes several barriers to the translation of butyrate and shows superior promise in slowing atherosclerosis and liver injury compared with equidosed sodium butyrate."

    "text": "Skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling depends on the direct coupling between CaV1.1 on the sarcolemma and ryanodine receptor (RyR1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A key regulator of this process is STAC3, a protein essential for both the functional expression of CaV1.1 and its conformational coupling with RyR1. Mutations in Stac3 cause STAC3 disorder, a congenital myopathy characterized by muscle weakness. STAC3 interacts with CaV1.1 in 2 key regions: the II-III loop and the proximal C-terminus. While the II-III loop has been previously found to be essential for skeletal muscle EC coupling, here we demonstrated that the interaction between STAC3 and the proximal C-terminus is necessary and sufficient for CaV1.1 functional expression and minimal EC coupling. In contrast, the interaction with the II-III loop is not essential for EC coupling, though it plays a facilitating role in enhancing the process. Supporting this finding, we identified a patient with STAC3 disorder carrying a mutation that deletes the domain of STAC3 involved in the II-III loop interaction. Collectively, our results established that STAC3 binding to CaV1.1 C-terminus is essential for its functional expression, whereas STAC3 interaction with the II-III loop serves to enhance the conformational coupling with RyR1."

    "text": "PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: This systematic review aims to evaluate the evidence on replacing animal foods (eggs, red meat, processed meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products) with plant foods (fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, soy, and non-soy legumes) regarding cancer risk, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: A systematic search was done using PubMed and Web of Science, adhering to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that substituted animal foods or animal protein with plant foods or plant protein were considered. The ROBINS-E tool was used to assess the risk of bias. A total of 17 articles were included, thereof 14 cohort studies, one case-cohort study, and two pooled analyses of cohort studies. Replacing animal foods or animal protein with plant foods or plant protein was associated with a reduced cancer risk in six studies (two studies on colorectal cancer, one on rectal cancer, and three on breast cancer), whereas four studies found no associations (one each for liver, bladder, colon and total cancer). The substitution of animal foods or animal protein with plant foods or plant protein was associated with a lower risk of cancer mortality and total mortality in three and five studies, respectively. Meta-analysis was not conducted due to the high heterogeneity of the studies. Substituting animal foods with plant foods may contribute to reducing the risk of breast and colorectal cancer, cancer mortality, and total mortality. Future studies should assess the effect of this substitution on other cancer types."

    "text": "Mutations in Cullin-3 (CUL3) cause hypertension (HTN). We examined the role of smooth muscle cell (SMC) CUL3 in the regulation of renin gene expression. Mice with SMC-specific CUL3 deletion (S-CUL3-KO) developed severe HTN with paradoxically preserved levels of plasma angiotensin peptides and renal renin expression. Cre-recombinase was active in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, resulting in decreased CUL3 expression. We evaluated components of the renin cell baroreceptor and revealed preserved Lamin A/C but decreased integrin β1 expression in S-CUL3-KO. We hypothesized that Rab proteins are involved in integrin β1 downregulation. Silencing either Rab21 or Rab5 in CUL3-deficient HEK293 cells increased integrin β1 protein. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed a direct interaction between Rab5 and CUL3. CUL3 deficiency increased Rab5, suggesting it is regulated by a CUL3-mediated mechanism and that CUL3 deficiency results in loss of Rab protein turnover, leading to enhanced integrin β1 internalization. We conclude that the loss of integrin β1 from JG cells impairs the mechanosensory function of the renin cell baroreceptor, which underlies the persistent renin expression observed in hypertensive S-CUL3-KO mice. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of HTN, revealing that dysregulation of Rab proteins and integrin β1 in the kidney due to CUL3 deficiency contributes to the development of HTN."

    "text": "Dominant missense mutations in MYBPC1, the gene encoding the essential sarcomeric slow Myosin Binding Protein-C (sMyBP-C), are associated with Myotrem, a new, early-onset congenital myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, skeletal deformities, and myogenic tremor. Importantly, the clinical manifestation of Myotrem in mid- and late adulthood is unknown. Using the Myotrem MYBPC1 E248K-knock-in (E248K-KI) murine model, we interrogated contractile performance of soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibalis anterior (TA) muscles in both male and female mice in mid- (12 months) and late (24 months) adulthood. Our findings show that the phenotypic manifestation of E248K Myotrem differs across muscle type, sex, and age. While KI soleus muscle consistently exhibited contractile impairment across both sexes and ages, KI gastrocnemius muscle displayed preserved force production. Interestingly, TA muscle showed a sex- and age-specific effect with preserved function through 12 months in both sexes and a sharp decline at 24 months solely in males. Quantitative analysis of TA sarcomeric organization uncovered structural deficits coinciding with contractile dysfunction, supporting the notion that sMyBP-C serves a primarily structural role in skeletal muscle. Collectively, our studies reveal that aging affects the E248K Myotrem myopathy in a muscle- and sex-dependent fashion and show that sarcomeric disorganization accompanies contractile deterioration in affected muscles."

    "text": "Primary liver cancer remains a major contributor to global cancer-related mortality. Echinacoside, a bioactive phenylethanoid glycoside isolated from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, has shown potent anti-tumor effects. In this study, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles encapsulating echinacoside (E@PLGA and E@PLGA-FA) were synthesized via the double emulsification method. Their physicochemical properties, drug release kinetics, and anti-cancer efficacy were systematically evaluated through in vitro and in vivo models. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses revealed that the particle sizes of E@PLGA and E@PLGA-FA were approximately 91 nm and 100 nm, respectively, with zeta potentials of -22.50 mV and -31.89 mV. The polydispersity index (PDI) of E@PLGA and E@PLGA-FA was determined to be 0.16 ± 0.01 and 0.19 ± 0.01, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency and drug-loading capacity of echinacoside in E@PLGA-FA were 28.78 % and 12.05 %, respectively, slightly lower than those in E@PLGA nanoparticles (40.34 % and 16.12 %), likely due to folic acid modification altering PLGA solubility during formulation. In vitro release profiles demonstrated pH-dependent drug release: 22 % at physiological pH (7.4) versus 67 % under acidic conditions (pH 5.5) over 12 h, indicating tumor microenvironment-responsive behavior. Furthermore, E@PLGA-FA significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells, induced apoptosis, caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and suppressed cell mobility. Meanwhile, the protein levels of MMP2, MMP9 and Bax were increased after exposure to E@PLGA and E@PLGA-FA, whereas the protein levels of COL-Ⅰ, COL-Ⅱ, Bcl-2, Cyclin D1, and PCNA were decreased. In vivo, E@PLGA-FA effectively inhibited tumor growth, induced tumor cell apoptosis, and exhibited tumor-specific accumulation confirmed by fluorescence imaging. In addition, The E@PLGA-FA nanoparticle intervention did not induce pathological damage or inflammatory responses in murine liver and kidney tissues, suggesting a favorable safety profile for this compound. In conclusion, we engineered a novel tumor-targeted PLGA-based nanoparticle system for echinacoside delivery, which synergizes pH-responsive drug release, multi-mechanistic anti-cancer effects, and biosafety, offering a promising therapeutic platform for hepatocellular carcinoma."

    "text": "Over the past three decades, several drugs have been developed to target three major dysfunctional pathways in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), including the prostacyclin, endothelin and nitric oxide pathways. Despite these advances, PAH remains incurable, necessitating further drug discovery efforts. New therapies focus on previously untargeted pathways, especially the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling pathway. Dysregulation of this pathway, involving the Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 signalling branches, plays a key role in pulmonary vascular remodelling. Sotatercept, a fusion protein acting as an activin receptor ligand trap to rebalance growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signalling has shown promise in clinical trials by reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, improving exercise capacity and lowering risk of a composite of morbi-mortality events. Other emerging treatments aim to restore balance within the BMP/TGF-β pathway. Therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as imatinib, inhibit the platelet-derived growth factor pathway. Though oral imatinib has shown efficacy, its side-effects have limited widespread use. Additional strategies exploring lower doses of imatinib and novel delivery methods, such as inhalation, to reduce systemic side-effects failed to demonstrate clinical benefit. Novel RTK inhibitors such as seralutinib administered by inhalation have shown promising results in a phase 2 clinical trial. Other emerging approaches include anti-inflammatory therapies, hormonal modulation and metabolism-targeting agents like ranolazine and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, which could expand the therapeutic landscape for PAH. Overall, the continued development of novel drugs targeting these pathways offers hope for better disease management and improved outcomes for patients with PAH."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Creatine transporter (CTD) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiencies are rare inborn errors of creatine metabolism, resulting in cerebral creatine deficiency. Patients with either condition commonly exhibit intellectual and developmental disabilities, often accompanied by behavior problems, delayed speech, seizures, and motor impairments. There is currently no efficacious treatment for CTD, while current management for GAMT requires lifelong treatment with a protein restricted diet and intake of high amounts of oral supplements. Efforts to conduct clinical trials on potential treatments for these disorders are made more difficult by the lack of clinical and patient-derived meaningful outcomes. A core outcome set (COS) can facilitate consistent use of outcomes in studies. The current effort included patient and caregiver perspectives into the outcome selection of a COS for CTD and GAMT.\n\nRESULTS: We partnered with caregivers and health professionals to establish the first COS for CTD and GAMT. The COS developed includes seven outcomes (\"Adaptive Functioning\", \"Cognitive Functioning\", \"Emotional Dysregulation\", \"MRS Brain Creatine\", \"Seizure/Convulsions\", \"Expressive Communication\", and \"Fine Motor Functions\") for both CTD and GAMT, and an additional outcome for GAMT (\"Serum/Plasma Guanidinoacetate\") that are important to stakeholders and consequently should be considered for measurement in every clinical trial. Caregivers were valued partners throughout the COS development process, which increased community engagement and facilitated caregiver empowerment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Development of this COS illustrates a patient-centered approach for clinical trial readiness for CTD and GAMT that if utilized will make clinical trial results comparable, minimize bias in clinical trial outcome selection, and promote efficient use of resources."

    "text": "Physical exercise of even a moderate intensity is beneficial in both the prevention of prediabetes and management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as skeletal muscle is a primary tissue responsible for glucose uptake. Exercise-evoked proteomic alterations in muscle of subjects with prediabetes are of great importance for the study of relationships between insulin resistance and exercise. Although data-dependent (DDA) proteomic analysis is a cornerstone of deep proteome profiling employed in the elucidation of skeletal muscle biology, data-independent (DIA) approaches gain popularity in the studies focused on data reproducibility and throughput. We compared various ion-chromatogram libraries assembled with the use of off-line high-pH fractionation (HpH), gas-phase fractionation (GPF) and libraryless DirectDIA in LC/MS/HRMS DIA proteomic analysis of muscle from normoglycemic (NGT) and prediabetic (IGT) subjects after 3 months of supervised, mixed-mode exercise. In our hands, GPF-fractionated, hybrid DDA/DIA libraries yielded the best overall balance between the speed of preparation, data collection and protein identification among tested approaches. Analysis revealed, that despite 3-month exercise intervention skeletal muscle from IGT subjects displayed significant alterations in pathways and molecules relevant to muscle contraction, extracellular matrix composition and protein synthesis as compared to NGT counterparts. In conclusion, our study underlines the importance of the ion library assembly in the DIA analysis of clinical samples and confirms at molecular level changes connected with deficiency of muscle function in the prediabetic state."

    "text": "Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most prevalent cancer worldwide and is classified as human papillomavirus (HPV) positive or negative. Substantial heterogeneity has been observed in the two groups, posing a significant clinical challenge. In the disease context, global transcriptional changes are likely driven by a few key genes that reflect the disease etiology more accurately compared to differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We implemented our network-based tool PathExt on 501 TCGA-HNSCC samples (64 HPV positive & 437 HPV negative) to characterize central genes in two subtypes, where in subtype 1, HPV-positive samples were considered as cases and negative as controls, and vice versa in subtype 2. We also identified DEGs and performed several analyses on multiple benchmarking datasets to compare the biology of central genes with DEGs. PathExt key genes performed better with respect to DEGs in both subtypes in recapitulating disease etiology. Gene ontology analysis using central genes revealed shared biological processes such as \"epithelial cell proliferation\" as well as subtype-specific processes (immune- and metabolic-related processes in subtype 1 and peptide-related processes in subtype 2). However, in the case of DEGs, no subtype-specific processes were seen. Additionally, PathExt central genes did better than DEGs on external validation datasets that were specific to HNSCC and included HNSCC-specific cancer driver genes, FDA-approved therapeutic targets, and pan-cancer tumor suppressor genes. Unlike DEGs, central genes exhibit significant expression in various cell types, enrichment for cancer hallmarks, and mutated protein systems. Central gene expression-based machine learning model shows better performance than DEGs in classifying responders/non-responders with 0.74 AUROC. Lastly, the top 10 potential therapeutic targets and drugs were proposed. Overall, we observed PathExt as a complementary approach to DEGs, characterizing common and HNSCC subtype-specific key genes associated with distinct HNSCC molecular subtypes."
